## Commands I've Learned

### Navigation

```bash
pwd                 # Print working directory
ls                  # List files
ls -la              # List all files with details
cd                  # Change directory
cd ..               # Go up one level
cd ~                # Go to home directory
cd -                # Go to previous directory
```

### File Operations

```bash
touch file.txt      # Create empty file
mkdir folder        # Create directory
mkdir -p a/b/c      # Create nested directories
rm file.txt         # Remove file
rm -r folder        # Remove directory recursively
cp src dest         # Copy
mv src dest         # Move or rename
```

### Viewing Files

```bash
cat file.txt        # Print entire file
less file.txt       # View with pagination (q to quit)
head -n 10 file.txt # First 10 lines
tail -n 10 file.txt # Last 10 lines
```

### Getting Help

```bash
man command         # Manual page
command --help      # Quick help
tldr command        # Simplified examples (install tldr first)
```
