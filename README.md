**_Context for my dear readers:_**
The data below is based on my personal ability to learn and make time commitments with **no gaming whatsoever**.
Although I ~~love gaming~~ love studying ..., I have to be very disciplined for this.

The usage of AI is prohibited **_(Read books / documentation / google research [if nothing works])_**

## Current Progress

**Currently Working On:** Foundation (Typing/Linux) + Track A (Odin HTML)

| Track          | Status         | Progress                         |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Foundation** | 🟡 In Progress | Typing (Home Row), Linux (LabEx) |
| **Track A**    | 🟡 In Progress | Odin Project: Computer Basics ✅ |
| **Track B**    | 🔴 Deferred    | Starting after employment        |
| **DSA**        | 🟡 In Progress | Starting Week 1 (not Month 3)    |
| **Job Search** | ⚪ Not Started | Begins Month 4                   |

**Typing Speed:** 15 WPM **_Due to wrong habit the WPM will drop massively might break u down early weeks_** (Home Row / Proper Technique) → Target: 100 WPM

**DSA Progress:** 0/100 minimum problems for interviews

**Applications Sent:** 0 (Starting Month 4)

## Philosophy & Principles

### The Goal

You will not just "learn to code." You will understand computers so deeply that:

1. Any new language takes days, not months
2. Any new framework is just syntax over concepts you already know
3. Bugs that stump others are obvious to you
4. You see the matrix — bytes, memory, network packets, everything

**But first:** You need a job. The goal for the first 6 months is employment. Deep understanding comes after financial stability.

### The Three Laws

**Law 1: Foundation Before Framework**
Learn JavaScript deeply before React. Learn C before Go. Learn TCP before HTTP.
_(Analogy: Learn to walk before you run, but don't wait until you can run a marathon before leaving the house)_

**Law 2: Build, Don't Just Watch**
For every hour of learning, spend two hours building. No exceptions.
Tutorials feel productive but aren't. Building is where learning happens.

**Law 3: Understand, Don't Memorize**
If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it.
_(Don't cry — take your time and read again. Understanding takes repetition.)_

### The Fourth Law (New)

**Law 4: Done > Perfect**

- A deployed messy project > A perfect project on your laptop
- A sent application with a typo > A resume you're still editing
- Code that works > Code you're still "improving"

Perfectionism is procrastination in disguise.

### Why Multiple Tracks?

| Track      | Purpose                              | Time Investment | Payoff Timeline |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------- | --------------- |
| Foundation | Skills that multiply everything else | 1-2 hrs/day     | Immediate       |
| Track A    | Employable skills, income            | 5-7 hrs/day     | 5-6 months      |
| DSA        | Pass interview gates                 | 1-2 hrs/day     | 4-6 months      |
| Job Search | Actually getting interviews          | 1-2 hrs/day     | Month 4+        |
| Track B    | Deep understanding (deferred)        | Weekends only   | 2-3 years       |

**They reinforce each other:**

- Foundation makes both tracks faster
- Track A pays bills while you master Track B
- DSA gets you past interview gates
- Track B makes you exceptional at Track A (long-term)

## Proposed Structure

> [!NOTE]
> The schedule timings are only a rough suggestion. Feel free to adjust them based on your comfort, availability, and learning pace.
> One important thing I strongly recommend is **no matter how busy or unmotivated you feel, try to code for at least 15 minutes every day.**
> Even a small daily effort makes a big difference over time.

## Schedule & Time Management

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **SUSTAINABLE SCHEDULE**
> The original 86 hrs/week is a recipe for burnout. This revised schedule is ~60-65 hrs/week — still aggressive but sustainable for 6 months.

> [!NOTE]
> Research shows deep work capacity maxes out at 4-6 hours/day. After that, retention drops significantly. Quality > Quantity.

### Daily Schedule (Weekdays) — Phase 1-3

```text
06:30 – 07:00  Wake up + Plan day + Review yesterday's notes
07:00 – 09:00  Track A — Deep Work Block 1 (2 hrs)
09:00 – 09:15  Break — walk, water, sunlight
09:15 – 11:15  Track A — Deep Work Block 2 (2 hrs)
11:15 – 11:30  Break — snack, rest eyes
11:30 – 13:00  Track A — Block 3 (1.5 hrs)
               → Total Track A morning = 5.5 hrs

13:00 – 14:00  Lunch + Full rest (NO SCREENS — this is important)

14:00 – 14:30  Job Applications (Month 4+) OR Foundation (Month 1-3)
14:30 – 16:00  Track A — Afternoon session (1.5 hrs)
               → Total Track A = 7 hrs/day

16:00 – 16:45  Foundation (typing + terminal + git) — 45 min
16:45 – 17:45  DSA — 1-2 problems (1 hr)
               → Start DSA from Week 1, not Month 3

17:45 – 18:00  Get ready → leave for badminton
18:00 – 21:00  Badminton + travel + shower + dinner (SACRED TIME)

21:00 – 22:30  Evening Session (1.5 hrs)
               → Alternating: Project work / DSA / Learning

22:30 – 23:00  Wind down, review day, plan tomorrow (no screens)
23:00 – 06:30  Sleep (7.5 hours) — NON-NEGOTIABLE
```

### Burnout Prevention Rules

> [!CAUTION]
> Burnout isn't a badge of honor. It's a productivity killer that sets you back weeks.

**Non-Negotiables:**

1. **Sleep 7+ hours** — Your brain consolidates learning during sleep
2. **Badminton/Exercise** — Keeps cognitive function high
3. **One full evening off** — Sunday evening is sacred
4. **One full day off per month** — No code, no thinking about code
5. **Lunch without screens** — Eyes and brain need rest

**Warning Signs:**

- Can't focus for more than 20 minutes
- Dreading the work you used to enjoy
- Mistakes increasing, not decreasing
- Trouble sleeping despite being tired
- Irritability, feeling hopeless

**If Burned Out:**

1. Take 2-3 full days off (no code)
2. Sleep as much as you need
3. Exercise, go outside
4. Return at 50% intensity
5. Gradually ramp back up

---

## Foundation Track

> **Timeline:** Weeks 1-4 intensive, then ongoing daily practice
> **Daily Time:** 45-90 minutes (evening slot)
> **Why This Matters:** These skills multiply ALL other learning. Skip this and you'll struggle forever.

This track runs BEFORE and PARALLEL to everything else. These skills multiply all other learning.

**The Math:**

- Typing at 40 WPM vs 80 WPM = 2x speed difference
- Terminal fluency = 3x faster file operations
- Git mastery = Never lose code, collaborate effectively
- Linux knowledge = Understand every server you'll ever touch

---

### F1: Touch Typing (Weeks 1-8)

> **Why this matters:** You'll type millions of lines in your career. 40 WPM vs 80 WPM is a 2x productivity difference. Wrong muscle memory now means fighting your own hands forever.

> **Time Investment:** ~30 min/day | **Total:** ~28 hours over 8 weeks

My typing is currently at 15-45 WPM with wrong hand placement. This is costing thousands of hours over a career.

**The Problem:**

- Wrong muscle memory is harder to fix than starting fresh
- You must UNLEARN before you learn
- This will feel slow and frustrating for 2-3 weeks
- Your WPM will DROP before it rises — this is normal and expected

**The Method:**

**Week 1-2: Complete Reset**

```text
1. Learn proper hand position (home row: A S D F — J K L ;)
2. Left pinky: A, Right pinky: ;
3. Left ring: S, Right ring: L
4. Left middle: D, Right middle: K
5. Left index: F (and G), Right index: J (and H)
6. Thumbs: Spacebar

Rules:
- Practice ONLY with proper technique, even if slower
- Do NOT look at keyboard — ever (cover it if needed)
- Accept that you'll drop to 15-20 WPM temporarily
- Focus on accuracy over speed (95%+ accuracy first)
```

**Week 3-4: Building Speed**

```text
1. Continue proper technique — no cheating
2. Aim for 98%+ accuracy before pushing speed
3. Speed comes naturally once accuracy is solid
4. Practice 30 minutes minimum daily (consistency > duration)
5. Track your progress daily
```

**Week 5-8: Programmer-Specific**

```text
1. Practice symbols: { } [ ] ( ) < > ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + =
2. Practice code snippets (not just English text)
3. Practice common patterns: function, const, return, if/else
4. Target: 60 WPM with 98% accuracy by Week 8
```

**Daily Practice Schedule:**

```text
Morning (optional):  5-10 min warmup on Keybr
Evening:            20-25 min focused practice on TypingClub
                    5 min speed test on MonkeyType
```

**Resources:**

| Resource   | Purpose                              | Link                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| TypingClub | Structured lessons, proper technique | https://www.typingclub.com/ |
| Keybr      | Adaptive practice, finds weak keys   | https://www.keybr.com/      |
| MonkeyType | Speed testing, programmer mode       | https://monkeytype.com/     |
| TypeRacer  | Gamified practice, competitive       | https://play.typeracer.com/ |
| Typing.com | Alternative structured course        | https://www.typing.com/     |

**Tracking Your Progress:**

Create a simple log in your notes:

```text
| Date       | WPM | Accuracy | Notes                    |
|------------|-----|----------|--------------------------|
| 2026-01-18 | 15  | 92%      | Day 1, feels awkward     |
| 2026-01-19 | 14  | 94%      | Slower but more accurate |
| 2026-01-20 | 16  | 95%      | Getting used to home row |
```

**Milestones:**

- [ ] Week 1: Comfortable with home row position
- [ ] Week 2: 25 WPM with proper technique
- [ ] Week 4: 40 WPM with 95% accuracy
- [ ] Week 8: 60 WPM with 98% accuracy
- [ ] Month 6: 80+ WPM (natural progression with daily use)

---

### F2: Terminal & Command Line Mastery (Weeks 1-6)

> **Why this matters:** Real developers live in the terminal. GUIs are training wheels. Every server you'll ever touch runs Linux with no GUI. Every build tool, every deployment, every serious debugging session — all terminal.

> **Time Investment:** ~30 min/day | **Total:** ~15 hours over 6 weeks

The terminal is your home. GUIs are for tourists.

**What to Learn (In Order):**

**Week 1: Navigation & Basics**

```bash
# Where am I?
pwd                     # Print working directory

# What's here?
ls                      # List files
ls -la                  # List all files (including hidden) with details
ls -lh                  # Human-readable file sizes

# Moving around
cd /path/to/dir         # Change directory (absolute path)
cd relative/path        # Change directory (relative path)
cd ..                   # Go up one directory
cd ~                    # Go to home directory
cd -                    # Go to previous directory

# Creating things
mkdir dirname           # Create directory
mkdir -p path/to/dir    # Create nested directories
touch filename          # Create empty file

# Removing things (BE CAREFUL)
rm filename             # Remove file
rm -r dirname           # Remove directory and contents
rm -rf dirname          # Force remove (DANGEROUS — no confirmation)
rmdir dirname           # Remove empty directory only

# Copying and moving
cp source dest          # Copy file
cp -r source dest       # Copy directory
mv source dest          # Move (or rename) file/directory

# Reading files
cat filename            # Print entire file
less filename           # View file (scrollable, press q to quit)
head filename           # First 10 lines
head -n 20 filename     # First 20 lines
tail filename           # Last 10 lines
tail -f filename        # Follow file (great for logs)

# Other basics
clear                   # Clear screen (or Ctrl+L)
history                 # Show command history
man command             # Manual for command (press q to quit)
command --help          # Quick help for command

# Tab completion — USE THIS CONSTANTLY
# Type first few letters, press Tab to autocomplete
```

**Week 2: File Operations & Permissions**

```bash
# File permissions
ls -l                   # Shows permissions like: -rwxr-xr-x
# First character: - (file) or d (directory)
# Next 9: rwx for owner, group, others
# r=read(4), w=write(2), x=execute(1)

chmod 755 file          # rwxr-xr-x (owner: all, others: read+execute)
chmod 644 file          # rw-r--r-- (owner: read+write, others: read)
chmod +x file           # Add execute permission
chmod -w file           # Remove write permission

# Ownership
chown user file         # Change owner
chown user:group file   # Change owner and group
chgrp group file        # Change group only

# Finding things
find . -name "*.js"              # Find all .js files in current dir
find . -type f -name "*.txt"     # Find files only (not directories)
find . -type d -name "src"       # Find directories named src
find . -mtime -7                 # Files modified in last 7 days
which command                    # Where is this command located?
whereis command                  # Find command binary, source, manual

# File information
file filename           # What type of file is this?
wc filename             # Word, line, character count
wc -l filename          # Just line count
du -sh dirname          # Disk usage of directory (human-readable)
df -h                   # Disk free space (all drives)
```

**Week 3: Text Processing**

```bash
# grep — search text (you'll use this constantly)
grep "pattern" file              # Find lines containing pattern
grep -i "pattern" file           # Case insensitive
grep -r "pattern" .              # Recursive search in directory
grep -n "pattern" file           # Show line numbers
grep -v "pattern" file           # Lines NOT containing pattern
grep -c "pattern" file           # Count matching lines

# Pipes — connect commands (THIS IS POWERFUL)
command1 | command2              # Output of command1 → input of command2
ls -la | grep ".js"              # List files, show only .js files
cat file | head -20              # First 20 lines of file
history | grep "git"             # Find git commands in history

# Redirection
command > file           # Output to file (overwrite)
command >> file          # Output to file (append)
command 2> file          # Errors to file
command &> file          # Both output and errors to file
command < file           # Input from file

# sed — stream editor (basic substitution)
sed 's/old/new/' file            # Replace first occurrence per line
sed 's/old/new/g' file           # Replace all occurrences
sed -i 's/old/new/g' file        # Edit file in place (careful!)

# awk — powerful text processing
awk '{print $1}' file            # Print first column
awk '{print $1, $3}' file        # Print first and third columns
awk -F',' '{print $2}' file      # Use comma as delimiter

# Other useful text tools
sort file                # Sort lines
sort -n file             # Sort numerically
sort -r file             # Reverse sort
uniq file                # Remove adjacent duplicates
sort file | uniq         # Remove all duplicates
cut -d',' -f1 file       # Cut first field (comma delimiter)
tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < file    # Translate lowercase to uppercase
```

**Week 4: Process Management**

```bash
# Viewing processes
ps                      # Your processes
ps aux                  # All processes (detailed)
ps aux | grep "node"    # Find node processes
top                     # Live process viewer (q to quit)
htop                    # Better process viewer (install separately)

# Process control
command &               # Run in background
jobs                    # List background jobs
fg                      # Bring last job to foreground
fg %1                   # Bring job 1 to foreground
bg                      # Continue stopped job in background
Ctrl+C                  # Kill foreground process
Ctrl+Z                  # Suspend (pause) foreground process

# Killing processes
kill PID                # Kill process by ID (graceful)
kill -9 PID             # Force kill (use as last resort)
killall processname     # Kill all processes with name
pkill -f "pattern"      # Kill processes matching pattern

# Environment variables
echo $PATH              # Print PATH variable
echo $HOME              # Print home directory
export VAR=value        # Set environment variable
printenv                # Print all environment variables

**Practice Project:**
Create a script that organizes your Downloads folder by file type automatically.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# organize-downloads.sh
# Organizes files in Downloads by extension

DOWNLOADS=~/Downloads

# Create directories
mkdir -p "$DOWNLOADS"/{Images,Documents,Videos,Music,Archives,Code,Other}

# Move files by extension
mv "$DOWNLOADS"/*.{jpg,jpeg,png,gif,svg,webp} "$DOWNLOADS/Images/" 2>/dev/null
mv "$DOWNLOADS"/*.{pdf,doc,docx,txt,xlsx,pptx} "$DOWNLOADS/Documents/" 2>/dev/null

### F3: Git Mastery (Weeks 2-8)

> **Why this matters:** Git is how every team collaborates. Most developers know 5 commands and panic when something goes wrong. You'll understand Git's internals and never fear a merge conflict again.

> **Time Investment:** ~20 min/day | **Total:** ~14 hours over 7 weeks

Most developers know 5 Git commands. You'll understand Git's object model and never fear a merge conflict again.

**Level 1: Basic Workflow (Week 2-3)**

```bash
# Starting a project
git init                        # Initialize new repo
git clone URL                   # Clone existing repo

# Basic workflow (do this 100x until automatic)
git status                      # What's changed? (run this constantly)
git add filename                # Stage specific file
git add .                       # Stage all changes
git commit -m "message"         # Commit staged changes
git push                        # Push to remote
git pull                        # Pull from remote

# Viewing history
git log                         # Commit history
git log --oneline               # Compact history
git log --oneline -10           # Last 10 commits
git show COMMIT                 # Show specific commit
git diff                        # Unstaged changes
git diff --staged               # Staged changes
git diff HEAD~1                 # Changes since last commit

# .gitignore — files to ignore
# Create .gitignore file:
node_modules/
.env
.DS_Store
*.log
dist/
```

**Level 2: Branching (Week 3-4)**

```bash
# Branch basics
git branch                      # List branches
git branch feature-name         # Create branch
git checkout feature-name       # Switch to branch
git checkout -b feature-name    # Create AND switch (use this)
git switch feature-name         # Modern way to switch
git switch -c feature-name      # Modern create and switch

# Merging
git checkout main               # Switch to main
git merge feature-name          # Merge feature into main
# Fast-forward merge: no conflicts, history is linear
# 3-way merge: creates merge commit

# Merge conflicts — DON'T PANIC
# Git marks conflicts like this:
<<<<<<< HEAD
your changes
=======
their changes
>>>>>>> feature-name

# To resolve:
# 1. Open file, manually edit to keep what you want
# 2. Remove the <<<, ===, >>> markers
# 3. git add filename
# 4. git commit

# Deleting branches
git branch -d feature-name      # Delete merged branch
git branch -D feature-name      # Force delete unmerged branch

# Stash — save work temporarily
git stash                       # Stash current changes
git stash list                  # List stashes
git stash pop                   # Apply and remove latest stash
git stash apply                 # Apply but keep stash
git stash drop                  # Delete latest stash
```

**Level 3: History Manipulation (Week 4-5)**

```bash
# Undoing things
git checkout -- filename        # Discard unstaged changes to file
git restore filename            # Modern way to discard changes
git reset HEAD filename         # Unstage file
git restore --staged filename   # Modern way to unstage

# Reset — moving HEAD (BE CAREFUL)
git reset --soft HEAD~1         # Undo commit, keep changes staged
git reset --mixed HEAD~1        # Undo commit, keep changes unstaged (default)
git reset --hard HEAD~1         # Undo commit, DELETE changes (dangerous)

# Revert — safe way to undo (creates new commit)
git revert COMMIT               # Create commit that undoes COMMIT

# Amend — fix last commit
git commit --amend -m "new msg" # Change last commit message
git add forgotten-file
git commit --amend              # Add file to last commit

# Cherry-pick — copy specific commit
git cherry-pick COMMIT          # Apply commit to current branch

# Reflog — your safety net (MEMORIZE THIS)
git reflog                      # History of HEAD movements
git checkout HEAD@{2}           # Go back to 2 moves ago
# Reflog saves you when you think you've lost work

# Interactive rebase (advanced, but powerful)
git rebase -i HEAD~3            # Edit last 3 commits
# Options: pick, reword, edit, squash, drop
```

**Level 4: Collaboration (Week 5-6)**

```bash
# Remotes
git remote -v                   # Show remotes
git remote add origin URL       # Add remote
git remote remove origin        # Remove remote

# Fetch vs Pull
git fetch origin                # Download changes, don't merge
git pull origin main            # Fetch AND merge (git fetch + git merge)

# Forking workflow (for open source)
# 1. Fork repo on GitHub
# 2. Clone YOUR fork
git clone https://github.com/YOU/repo.git
# 3. Add original as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL/repo.git
# 4. Keep fork updated
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main

# Pull request workflow
git checkout -b feature         # Create feature branch
# ... make changes ...
git push -u origin feature      # Push branch to your fork
# Go to GitHub → Create Pull Request

# Useful for collaboration
git blame filename              # Who changed each line?
git bisect start                # Find commit that introduced bug
git bisect bad                  # Current is bad
git bisect good COMMIT          # This commit was good
# Git will binary search to find the breaking commit
```

**Level 5: Git Internals (Week 7-8)**

Understanding how Git actually works makes everything click.

```bash
# The .git directory
.git/
├── HEAD                # Pointer to current branch
├── config              # Repo configuration
├── objects/            # All data (blobs, trees, commits)
├── refs/               # Pointers to commits (branches, tags)
└── index               # Staging area

# Git objects — everything is a hash
git hash-object file            # Get hash of file content
git cat-file -t HASH            # Type of object
git cat-file -p HASH            # Pretty print object

# Object types
# blob   — file contents
# tree   — directory structure (list of blobs and trees)
# commit — snapshot (points to tree + metadata + parents)
# tag    — named pointer to commit

# Commits are snapshots, not diffs
# Each commit stores complete state, not changes
# Git is smart about storage (packing, deduplication)
```

**Commit Message Best Practices:**

```bash
# Use conventional commits
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve login redirect bug
docs: update API documentation
style: format code with prettier
refactor: simplify auth middleware
test: add tests for user service
chore: update dependencies

# Structure
<type>: <short description>      # 50 chars max

<longer description if needed>   # 72 chars per line

<footer: references, breaking changes>

# Examples
feat: add shopping cart functionality

Implement add to cart, remove from cart, and cart total calculation.
Cart persists to localStorage for logged-out users.

Closes #123

---

fix: prevent crash on empty user input

Check for null/undefined before processing user input in the
search function. Previously, empty input caused TypeError.

Fixes #456
```

### F4: Text Editor Mastery (Weeks 2-8)

> **Why this matters:** Your editor is your instrument. A musician doesn't look at their fingers. You shouldn't either. Mastering shortcuts makes you 3-5x faster at actual coding.

> **Time Investment:** Learn shortcuts as you code | Dedicated practice: ~15 min/day

Choose ONE and master it:

> [!TIP]
> **Recommended:** Start with VS Code. Later, install the Vim extension to get the best of both worlds.

**Option A: VS Code (Recommended for beginners)**

**Option B: Vim/Neovim (For Track B depth or VS Code Vim extension)**

**Week 2-3: Survival Mode**

```text
MODES (The most important concept)
Normal mode         Default, for navigation and commands
Insert mode         For typing text
Visual mode         For selecting text
Command mode        For running commands (:)

ENTERING INSERT MODE (from Normal)
i                   Insert before cursor
a                   Insert after cursor
I                   Insert at beginning of line
A                   Insert at end of line
o                   Open new line below
O                   Open new line above

RETURNING TO NORMAL MODE
Esc                 Always returns to Normal mode
Ctrl+[              Same as Esc (easier to reach)

### F5: Linux Fundamentals (Weeks 3-10)

> **Why this matters:** Every server runs Linux. Every cloud runs Linux. WSL is a taste, not a meal. Understanding Linux means understanding how computers actually work at the OS level.

> **Time Investment:** ~30 min/day | **Total:** ~28 hours over 8 weeks

WSL is not enough. You need to understand Linux as an operating system.

**What to Learn:**

**Week 3-4: User & System Basics**

```bash
# User management
sudo useradd username            # Create user
sudo useradd -m username         # Create user with home directory
sudo passwd username             # Set password
sudo usermod -aG groupname user  # Add user to group
sudo userdel username            # Delete user
sudo userdel -r username         # Delete user and home directory

# Groups
groups                           # Your groups
groups username                  # User's groups
sudo groupadd groupname          # Create group
sudo groupdel groupname          # Delete group

# Understanding sudo
sudo command                     # Run as root
sudo -i                          # Become root
sudo su -                        # Switch to root user
visudo                           # Edit sudoers file (safe way)

# Package management (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt update                  # Update package lists
sudo apt upgrade                 # Upgrade all packages
sudo apt install package         # Install package
sudo apt remove package          # Remove package
sudo apt autoremove              # Remove unused dependencies
apt search keyword               # Search for packages
apt show package                 # Package info

# Package management (Fedora/RHEL)
sudo dnf update                  # Update packages
sudo dnf install package         # Install package
sudo dnf remove package          # Remove package

# Services (systemd)
sudo systemctl start service     # Start service
sudo systemctl stop service      # Stop service
sudo systemctl restart service   # Restart service
sudo systemctl status service    # Check status
sudo systemctl enable service    # Start on boot
sudo systemctl disable service   # Don't start on boot
journalctl -u service            # View service logs
```

**Week 5-6: File System Deep Dive**

```bash
# Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
/                   # Root directory
/home               # User home directories
/root               # Root user's home
/etc                # Configuration files
/var                # Variable data (logs, databases)
/tmp                # Temporary files (cleared on reboot)
/usr                # User programs and data
/usr/bin            # User binaries
/usr/local          # Locally installed software
/opt                # Optional/third-party software
/bin                # Essential binaries
/sbin               # System binaries
/lib                # Shared libraries
/dev                # Device files
/proc               # Process information (virtual)
/sys                # System information (virtual)
/mnt                # Mount points
/media              # Removable media

# Inodes
ls -i file                       # Show inode number
stat file                        # Detailed file info
df -i                            # Inode usage

# Links
ln target linkname               # Hard link (same inode)
ln -s target linkname            # Symbolic link (pointer)
# Hard links: same inode, can't cross filesystems
# Symbolic links: pointer to path, can cross filesystems

# Mounting
mount                            # Show mounted filesystems
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt        # Mount device
sudo umount /mnt                 # Unmount
cat /etc/fstab                   # Filesystem table (auto-mount)
```

**Week 7-8: Processes & Memory**

```bash
# Process concepts
# PID: Process ID
# PPID: Parent Process ID
# Every process has a parent (except init/systemd)
# Orphan processes adopted by init

# Process states
# R: Running
# S: Sleeping (waiting for event)
# D: Uninterruptible sleep (usually I/O)
# Z: Zombie (terminated, parent hasn't read exit status)
# T: Stopped

# Viewing processes
ps aux                           # All processes
ps -ef                           # Full format
pstree                           # Process tree
pgrep processname                # Find PID by name

# /proc filesystem
cat /proc/cpuinfo                # CPU information
cat /proc/meminfo                # Memory information
cat /proc/PID/status             # Process status
ls /proc/PID/fd                  # Process file descriptors

# Signals
kill -l                          # List all signals
kill PID                         # SIGTERM (graceful shutdown)
kill -9 PID                      # SIGKILL (force kill)
kill -HUP PID                    # SIGHUP (reload config)
kill -STOP PID                   # SIGSTOP (pause)
kill -CONT PID                   # SIGCONT (resume)

# Memory
free -h                          # Memory usage
cat /proc/meminfo                # Detailed memory info
vmstat 1                         # Virtual memory stats every 1s
# Swap: disk space used as memory overflow
swapon --show                    # Show swap
```

**Week 9-10: Networking & Security**

```bash
# Firewall (UFW - Uncomplicated Firewall)
sudo ufw status                  # Check status
sudo ufw enable                  # Enable firewall
sudo ufw disable                 # Disable firewall
sudo ufw allow 22                # Allow SSH
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp            # Allow HTTP
sudo ufw deny 23                 # Deny telnet
sudo ufw delete allow 80         # Remove rule

# SSH configuration
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config         # SSH server config
# Key-based authentication (more secure than passwords)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519            # Generate key pair
ssh-copy-id user@host            # Copy public key to server

# File permissions deep dive
# Special permissions
chmod u+s file                   # SUID - run as owner
chmod g+s dir                    # SGID - inherit group
chmod +t dir                     # Sticky bit - only owner can delete

# ACLs (Access Control Lists)
getfacl file                     # View ACLs
setfacl -m u:user:rwx file       # Set ACL

# Security basics
last                             # Login history
lastb                            # Failed login attempts
who                              # Who is logged in
w                                # Who is logged in (detailed)
```

### F6: Shell Scripting — Bash (Weeks 6-12)

> **Why this matters:** Automation. A good script saves hundreds of hours. Every CI/CD pipeline, every deployment, every system task — it's all shell scripts underneath.

> **Time Investment:** ~30 min/day | **Total:** ~21 hours over 7 weeks

Automate everything. A good script saves hundreds of hours.

**What to Learn:**

**Week 6-7: Basics**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# The shebang ^ tells the system which interpreter to use

# Variables (no spaces around =)
name="Rhythm"
age=21
echo "Hello, $name"
echo "Age: ${age}"

# User input
read -p "Enter your name: " username
echo "Hello, $username"

# Arguments
# $0 = script name
# $1, $2, etc. = arguments
# $@ = all arguments
# $# = number of arguments
echo "Script: $0"
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "All arguments: $@"
echo "Number of arguments: $#"

# Exit codes
# 0 = success
# non-zero = failure
exit 0
exit 1

# Check last command's exit code
echo "hello"
echo $?  # Prints 0 (success)

# Comments
# This is a single-line comment

: '
This is a
multi-line comment
'
```

**Week 8-9: Control Flow**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# If statements
if [ condition ]; then
    echo "True"
elif [ other_condition ]; then
    echo "Other"
else
    echo "False"
fi

# Comparison operators (test command / [ ])
# String comparison
[ "$a" = "$b" ]      # Equal
[ "$a" != "$b" ]     # Not equal
[ -z "$a" ]          # Empty string
[ -n "$a" ]          # Not empty string

# Numeric comparison
[ "$a" -eq "$b" ]    # Equal
[ "$a" -ne "$b" ]    # Not equal
[ "$a" -lt "$b" ]    # Less than
[ "$a" -le "$b" ]    # Less than or equal
[ "$a" -gt "$b" ]    # Greater than
[ "$a" -ge "$b" ]    # Greater than or equal

# File tests
[ -f "$file" ]       # Is a regular file
[ -d "$dir" ]        # Is a directory
[ -e "$path" ]       # Exists
[ -r "$file" ]       # Is readable
[ -w "$file" ]       # Is writable
[ -x "$file" ]       # Is executable

# Logical operators
[ cond1 ] && [ cond2 ]   # AND
[ cond1 ] || [ cond2 ]   # OR
! [ condition ]          # NOT

# Modern test: [[ ]] (preferred)
[[ "$a" == "$b" ]]       # Pattern matching
[[ "$a" =~ regex ]]      # Regex matching

# Case statement
case "$variable" in
    pattern1)
        echo "Pattern 1"
        ;;
    pattern2|pattern3)
        echo "Pattern 2 or 3"
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Default"
        ;;
esac

# Loops
# For loop
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
    echo "$i"
done

for i in {1..10}; do
    echo "$i"
done

for file in *.txt; do
    echo "Processing $file"
done

for ((i=0; i<10; i++)); do
    echo "$i"
done

# While loop
count=0
while [ $count -lt 5 ]; do
    echo "$count"
    ((count++))
done

# Until loop
until [ $count -ge 10 ]; do
    echo "$count"
    ((count++))
done

# Loop control
break       # Exit loop
continue    # Skip to next iteration
```

**Week 10-11: Functions & Advanced**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function definition
function greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1"
}

# Alternative syntax
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1"
}

# Calling functions
greet "World"

# Return values

**Week 12: Real Scripts**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example: Backup script

set -e          # Exit on error
set -u          # Error on undefined variable
set -o pipefail # Catch errors in pipes

# Configuration
BACKUP_DIR="/backup"
SOURCE_DIR="/home/user/projects"
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S)
BACKUP_NAME="backup_${DATE}.tar.gz"

# Logging function
log() {
    echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $1"
}

# Error handling
error_exit() {
    log "ERROR: $1"
    exit 1
}

# Check if backup directory exists
if [[ ! -d "$BACKUP_DIR" ]]; then
    mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR" || error_exit "Failed to create backup directory"
fi

# Create backup
log "Starting backup..."
tar -czf "${BACKUP_DIR}/${BACKUP_NAME}" "$SOURCE_DIR" || error_exit "Backup failed"

# Remove old backups (keep last 7)
log "Cleaning old backups..."
ls -t "${BACKUP_DIR}"/backup_*.tar.gz | tail -n +8 | xargs -r rm

log "Backup completed: ${BACKUP_NAME}"
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example: System monitoring script

get_cpu_usage() {
    top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d'%' -f1
}

get_memory_usage() {
    free | grep Mem | awk '{printf("%.1f"), $3/$2 * 100}'
}

get_disk_usage() {
    df -h / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d'%' -f1
}

echo "=== System Status ==="
echo "CPU Usage: $(get_cpu_usage)%"
echo "Memory Usage: $(get_memory_usage)%"
echo "Disk Usage: $(get_disk_usage)%"

# Alert if usage is high
cpu=$(get_cpu_usage)
if (( $(echo "$cpu > 80" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "WARNING: High CPU usage!"
fi
```

### F7: Regular Expressions (Weeks 8-12)

> **Why this matters:** Every validation, every search, every text processing task uses regex. Log parsing, data extraction, find-and-replace — regex is everywhere.

> **Time Investment:** ~20 min/day | **Total:** ~10 hours over 5 weeks

**What to Learn:**

**Week 8-9: Basics**

```text
LITERAL CHARACTERS
abc                 Matches "abc"
123                 Matches "123"

METACHARACTERS (have special meaning)
.                   Any single character (except newline)
^                   Start of line/string
$                   End of line/string
*                   Zero or more of previous
+                   One or more of previous
?                   Zero or one of previous
\                   Escape special character
|                   OR (alternation)
()                  Grouping
[]                  Character class

```text
LOOKAHEAD (look forward without consuming)
(?=pattern)         Positive lookahead (followed by)
(?!pattern)         Negative lookahead (not followed by)

Examples:
\d+(?=px)           Digits followed by "px" (matches "100" in "100px")
\d+(?!px)           Digits NOT followed by "px"

LOOKBEHIND (look backward without consuming)
(?<=pattern)        Positive lookbehind (preceded by)
(?<!pattern)        Negative lookbehind (not preceded by)

Examples:
(?<=\$)\d+          Digits preceded by "$" (matches "50" in "$50")
(?<!\$)\d+          Digits NOT preceded by "$"

FLAGS

i                   Case insensitive
m                   Multiline (^ and $ match line boundaries)
s                   Dotall (. matches newline too)

COMMON PATTERNS

### F8: Meta-Learning & Problem Solving (Ongoing)

> **Why this matters:** How you learn matters more than what you learn first. The best developers aren't the ones who know the most — they're the ones who learn the fastest.

> **Time Investment:** Not time-boxed — this is how you approach everything

**Learning Principles:**

**1. Feynman Technique**

```text
1. Study a concept
2. Explain it in simple terms (write it down or speak aloud)
3. Identify gaps in your explanation (where you got stuck)
4. Go back and fill the gaps
5. Simplify further — can you explain it to a 12-year-old?

If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yet.
```

**2. Spaced Repetition**

```text
Review schedule:
- After 1 day
- After 3 days
- After 7 days
- After 14 days
- After 30 days

Use Anki for key concepts:
- Make your own cards (the making IS learning)
- Keep cards atomic (one concept per card)
- Review daily (15-20 min)
```

**3. Active Recall**

```text
- Don't re-read, test yourself
- Close the book and try to remember
- Struggle is good — it strengthens memory
- Use flashcards, practice problems, teaching
- If you can't recall it, you haven't learned it
```

**4. Interleaving**

```text
- Mix different topics in one session
- Harder short-term, better long-term
- Example: 30 min JS, 30 min CSS, 30 min DSA
- Not: 2 hours JS, then 2 hours CSS
```

**5. Pomodoro Technique**

```text
1. Set timer for 25 minutes
2. Work with full focus (no distractions)
3. Take 5 minute break
4. Repeat 4 times
5. Take 15-30 minute break
```

**Problem-Solving Framework:**

```text
1. UNDERSTAND
   - What are the inputs?
   - What are the outputs?
   - What are the constraints?
   - Can I restate the problem in my own words?
   - What are the edge cases?

2. PLAN
   - Have I seen similar problems before?
   - Can I solve a simpler version first?
   - Can I break it into subproblems?
   - What data structures might help?
   - Can I visualize it? (draw diagrams)

3. EXECUTE
   - Start with brute force (get something working)
   - Code the solution step by step
   - Write tests first if possible
   - Don't optimize prematurely

4. REVIEW
   - Does it work for all edge cases?
   - Can it be cleaner? More readable?
   - What's the time/space complexity?
   - What did I learn?
   - Document the approach
```

**Debugging Framework:**

```text
1. REPRODUCE
   - Can I reliably trigger the bug?
   - What's the minimal reproduction case?
   - What inputs cause the problem?

2. ISOLATE
   - Where exactly does it fail?
   - Binary search through code (comment out half)
   - Add console.log strategically
   - Use debugger breakpoints

3. UNDERSTAND
   - WHY is it happening?
   - What's the root cause?
   - Don't just fix symptoms

4. FIX
   - Fix the root cause
   - Add a test that would have caught this
   - Consider if similar bugs exist elsewhere

5. VERIFY
   - Does the fix work?
   - Did it break anything else?
   - Do all tests pass?
```

### F9: Note-Taking & Knowledge Management (Ongoing)

> **Why this matters:** Your second brain. Knowledge compounds only if captured. In 2 years, you'll have learned thousands of things — if you don't write them down, you'll forget 90%.

> **Time Investment:** 10-15 min/day for daily notes

**The System:**

**1. Daily Notes**

```text
What to capture:
- What I learned today (bullet points)
- Questions that arose (things to research)
- Problems I solved (and how)
- Insights and "aha" moments
- Links to resources I found useful
```

**2. Concept Notes**

```text
- One concept per note
- Explain in your OWN words
- Include code examples
- Link to related concepts
- Add questions you still have
```

**3. Project Notes**

```text
- What am I building?
- Architecture decisions (and WHY)
- Problems encountered and solutions
- Things to improve
- Lessons learned
```

**Obsidian Structure (Recommended):**

### Month 1-2: Web Foundations

These are the building blocks. HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin, JavaScript is the brain. Rush through this and you'll regret it forever.

---

#### A1.1: HTML5 (Week 1-2)

> **Why this matters:** HTML is not "easy" — it's fundamental. Bad HTML means bad SEO, bad accessibility, bad everything. Most developers write garbage HTML because they rushed through it.

> **Time Investment:** ~2-3 hrs/day | **Total:** ~30 hours over 2 weeks

**What to Learn (In Order):**

**Day 1-2: Document Basics**

```html
<!-- The DOCTYPE declaration - tells browser this is HTML5 -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- The root element - lang attribute helps screen readers -->
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Character encoding - always use UTF-8 -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />

    <!-- Responsive viewport - essential for mobile -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <!-- Page title - shows in browser tab, important for SEO -->
    <title>Page Title</title>

    <!-- Meta description - shows in search results -->
    <meta name="description" content="Page description for SEO" />

    <!-- Link to CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->

    <!-- Scripts at the end of body (or use defer) -->
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Day 3-4: Text Content**

```html
<!-- Headings - h1 is most important, use only ONE h1 per page -->
<h1>Main Page Title</h1>
<h2>Section Heading</h2>
<h3>Subsection</h3>
<h4>Sub-subsection</h4>
<h5>Minor heading</h5>
<h6>Smallest heading</h6>

<!-- Paragraphs and inline text -->
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<p>Another paragraph with <strong>bold (important)</strong> text.</p>
<p>Text with <em>emphasis (italic)</em> for stress.</p>
<p>Text with <mark>highlighted</mark> portions.</p>

<!-- Line break and horizontal rule -->
<p>Line one<br />Line two</p>
<hr />
<!-- Thematic break -->

<!-- Quotes -->
<blockquote cite="https://source.com">
  <p>This is a longer quotation from another source.</p>
  <cite>— Author Name</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>She said <q>this is an inline quote</q> in her speech.</p>

<!-- Code -->
<p>Use the <code>console.log()</code> function to debug.</p>

<pre><code>
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello World");
}
</code></pre>

<!-- Other useful elements -->
<p><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is fun.</p>
<p>Published on <time datetime="2026-01-18">January 18, 2026</time></p>
<p>The result is <del>wrong</del> <ins>correct</ins>.</p>
<p>Water formula: H<sub>2</sub>O. Math: x<sup>2</sup></p>
```

**Day 5-6: Links & Media**

```html
<!-- Links -->
<a href="https://example.com">External link</a>
<a href="/about">Internal link (same site)</a>
<a href="#section-id">Jump to section on same page</a>
<a href="mailto:email@example.com">Email link</a>
<a href="tel:+1234567890">Phone link</a>

<!-- Link with target -->
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Opens in new tab
</a>
<!-- rel="noopener noreferrer" is security best practice for target="_blank" -->

<!-- Images -->

**Day 11-14: Semantic HTML**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Semantic HTML Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Header - introductory content, navigation -->
    <header>
      <nav aria-label="Main navigation">
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>

    <!-- Main - primary content of the page (only one per page) -->
    <main>
      <!-- Article - self-contained content -->
      <article>
        <header>
          <h1>Article Title</h1>
          <p>

        <!-- Section - thematic grouping -->
        <section>
          <h2>Section Heading</h2>

          <p>More content...</p>
        </section>

        <footer>
          <p>Tags: <a href="/tag/html">HTML</a>, <a href="/tag/web">Web</a></p>
        </footer>

      </nav>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Why Semantics Matter:**

```text
1. ACCESSIBILITY
   - Screen readers understand the page structure
   - Users can navigate by landmarks (header, main, footer)
   - Proper headings create a document outline

2. SEO
   - Search engines understand your content better
   - Articles are recognized as main content
   - Navigation is identified correctly

3. MAINTAINABILITY
   - Code is self-documenting
   - Easier to style with CSS
   - Other developers understand the structure

4. FUTURE-PROOFING
   - New tools and browsers will understand your markup
   - AI and assistive technologies work better
```

**ARIA Basics (Accessibility):**

```html
<!-- ARIA roles (use semantic HTML first, ARIA as fallback) -->
<div role="navigation">...</div>
<!-- Better: use <nav> -->
<div role="main">...</div>
<!-- Better: use <main> -->

<!-- ARIA labels -->
<button aria-label="Close menu">X</button>
<nav aria-label="Main navigation">...</nav>
<nav aria-label="Footer navigation">...</nav>

<!-- ARIA for dynamic content -->
<div aria-live="polite">Content that updates will be announced</div>
<button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="menu">Menu</button>
<div id="menu" hidden>...</div>

<!-- Hidden from screen readers -->
<span aria-hidden="true">🔥</span>
<!-- Decorative only -->
```

**Resources:**

| Resource            | Purpose         | Link                                              |

#### A1.2: CSS3 (Week 3-5)

> **Why this matters:** CSS is where most people get stuck and frustrated. They learn random properties without understanding the system. Learn the box model and layout systems properly — everything else is just details.

> **Time Investment:** ~2-3 hrs/day | **Total:** ~45 hours over 3 weeks

**What to Learn (In Order):**

**Week 3: Fundamentals**

**Day 1-2: Selectors & Specificity**

```css
/* ========== SELECTORS ========== */

/* Element selector */
p {
  color: blue;
}
h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
}

/* Class selector (most common) */
.card {
  padding: 20px;
}
.btn {
  border-radius: 4px;
}

/* ID selector (use sparingly) */
#header {
  background: #333;
}

/* Attribute selectors */
[type="text"] {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
[href^="https"] {
  color: green;
} /* Starts with */
[href$=".pdf"] {
  color: red;
} /* Ends with */
[class*="btn"] {
  cursor: pointer;
} /* Contains */

/* Pseudo-classes (state-based) */
a:hover {
  color: red;
}
a:focus {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
a:active {
  color: darkred;
}
input:focus {
  border-color: blue;
}
button:disabled {
  opacity: 0.5;
}
li:first-child {
  font-weight: bold;
}
li:last-child {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
li:nth-child(odd) {
  background: #f0f0f0;
}
li:nth-child(3n) {
  color: blue;
} /* Every 3rd */
input:required {
  border-left: 3px solid red;
}
input:valid {
  border-color: green;
}
input:invalid {
  border-color: red;
}

/* Pseudo-elements (parts of elements) */
p::first-line {
  font-weight: bold;
}
p::first-letter {
  font-size: 2em;
}
.quote::before {
  content: "" "; }
.quote::after { content: " "";
}
input::placeholder {
  color: #999;
}
::selection {
  background: yellow;
}

/* Combinators */
div p {
} /* Descendant: p inside div (any level) */
div > p {
} /* Child: p directly inside div */
h1 + p {
} /* Adjacent sibling: p immediately after h1 */
h1 ~ p {
} /* General sibling: p after h1 (same parent) */

/* Grouping */
h1,
h2,
h3 {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

/* ========== SPECIFICITY ========== */
/*
   Specificity determines which rule wins when multiple rules match.

   Calculated as: (inline, IDs, classes, elements)

   Examples:
   p                    → (0, 0, 0, 1)
   .card                → (0, 0, 1, 0)
   #header              → (0, 1, 0, 0)
   style="..."          → (1, 0, 0, 0) - inline style

   .card p              → (0, 0, 1, 1)
   #header .nav a       → (0, 1, 1, 1)

   Higher specificity wins!
   Same specificity? Last rule wins.

   !important overrides everything (avoid using it)
*/

/* Avoid !important - it makes debugging hard */
.btn {
  color: blue !important; /* BAD - hard to override */
}

/* Better: use more specific selector */
.sidebar .btn {
  color: blue;
}
```

**Day 3-4: The Box Model (MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPT)**

```css
/*
   EVERY element is a box with:

   ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
   │              MARGIN                  │ ← Space outside border
   │  ┌────────────────────────────────┐  │
   │  │           BORDER               │  │ ← The border itself
   │  │  ┌──────────────────────────┐  │  │
   │  │  │        PADDING           │  │  │ ← Space inside border
   │  │  │  ┌────────────────────┐  │  │  │
   │  │  │  │     CONTENT        │  │  │  │ ← Your actual content
   │  │  │  └────────────────────┘  │  │  │
   │  │  └──────────────────────────┘  │  │
   │  └────────────────────────────────┘  │
   └──────────────────────────────────────┘
*/

/* ALWAYS use border-box sizing */
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
/*
   content-box (default): width/height = content only
   border-box: width/height = content + padding + border

   border-box is much easier to work with!
*/

/* Box properties */
.box {
  /* Size */
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  min-width: 100px;
  max-width: 500px;
  min-height: 50px;
  max-height: 400px;

  /* Padding (inside) */
  padding: 20px; /* All sides */
  padding: 10px 20px; /* Vertical | Horizontal */
  padding: 10px 20px 30px; /* Top | Horizontal | Bottom */
  padding: 10px 20px 30px 40px; /* Top | Right | Bottom | Left */
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-right: 20px;
  padding-bottom: 30px;
  padding-left: 40px;

  /* Border */
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-width: 1px;
  border-style: solid; /* solid, dashed, dotted, double, none */
  border-color: #ccc;
  border-radius: 8px; /* Rounded corners */
  border-radius: 50%; /* Circle (if square element) */

  /* Margin (outside) */
  margin: 20px;
  margin: 0 auto; /* Center horizontally */
  margin-top: 20px;
  /* Same patterns as padding */
}

/* MARGIN COLLAPSE - Important to understand! */
/*
   Vertical margins between adjacent elements collapse.
   Only the larger margin is used.

   If element A has margin-bottom: 20px
   And element B has margin-top: 30px
   The space between them is 30px, NOT 50px.

   This doesn't happen with:
   - Horizontal margins
   - Flexbox items
   - Grid items
   - Floated elements
*/
```

**Day 5-7: Display & Positioning**

```css
/* ========== DISPLAY ========== */

/* Block: takes full width, stacks vertically */
.block {
  display: block;
  /* Default for: div, p, h1-h6, section, article, header, footer */
}

/* Inline: flows with text, no width/height control */
.inline {
  display: inline;
  /* Default for: span, a, strong, em, img */
}

/* Inline-block: inline flow, but respects width/height */
.inline-block {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
}

/* None: removes from layout completely */
.hidden {
  display: none;
}

/* ========== POSITIONING ========== */

/* Static (default): normal flow */
.static {
  position: static;
}

/* Relative: positioned relative to its normal position */
.relative {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px; /* Moves down 10px from original position */
  left: 20px; /* Moves right 20px */
  /* Original space is preserved */
}

/* Absolute: positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor */
.absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  /* Removed from normal flow */
  /* Parent must be position: relative (or other non-static) */
}

/* Fixed: positioned relative to viewport */
.fixed {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  /* Stays in place when scrolling */
  /* Great for: sticky headers, modals */
}

/* Sticky: hybrid of relative and fixed */
.sticky {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  /* Acts relative until scroll position, then fixed */
  /* Great for: sticky headers that scroll into view */
}

/* Z-index: stacking order (only works on positioned elements) */
.modal {
  position: fixed;
  z-index: 1000; /* Higher = on top */
}
.overlay {
  position: fixed;
  z-index: 999;
}

/* Stacking context: created by certain properties */
/* Each stacking context is independent */
```

**Week 4: Layout Systems**

**Day 1-3: Flexbox (1D Layout)**

```css
/*
   FLEXBOX is for ONE-DIMENSIONAL layout
   Either a row OR a column (not both at once)

   Main axis: direction items flow (horizontal or vertical)
   Cross axis: perpendicular to main axis
*/

/* CONTAINER (parent) */
.flex-container {
  display: flex; /* or inline-flex */

  /* Direction */
  flex-direction: row; /* Default: left to right */
  flex-direction: row-reverse; /* Right to left */
  flex-direction: column; /* Top to bottom */
  flex-direction: column-reverse; /* Bottom to top */

  /* Wrapping */
  flex-wrap: nowrap; /* Default: all in one line */
  flex-wrap: wrap; /* Wrap to new lines */
  flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;

  /* Shorthand */
  flex-flow: row wrap;

  /* Alignment on MAIN axis */
  justify-content: flex-start; /* Default: start of main axis */
  justify-content: flex-end; /* End of main axis */
  justify-content: center; /* Center */
  justify-content: space-between; /* Equal space between items */
  justify-content: space-around; /* Equal space around items */
  justify-content: space-evenly; /* Equal space everywhere */

  /* Alignment on CROSS axis */
  align-items: stretch; /* Default: fill container height */
  align-items: flex-start; /* Top (for row) */
  align-items: flex-end; /* Bottom (for row) */
  align-items: center; /* Center */
  align-items: baseline; /* Align text baselines */

  /* Multi-line alignment (when wrapping) */
  align-content: flex-start;
  align-content: center;
  align-content: space-between;

  /* Gap between items */
  gap: 20px;
  row-gap: 10px;
  column-gap: 20px;
}

/* ITEMS (children) */
.flex-item {
  /* Growing and shrinking */
  flex-grow: 0; /* Default: don't grow */
  flex-grow: 1; /* Grow to fill available space */
  flex-grow: 2; /* Grow twice as much as flex-grow: 1 */

  flex-shrink: 1; /* Default: shrink if needed */
  flex-shrink: 0; /* Don't shrink */

  flex-basis: auto; /* Default: use width/height */
  flex-basis: 200px; /* Start at 200px, then grow/shrink */
  flex-basis: 0; /* Ignore content size, distribute space evenly */

  /* Shorthand: grow shrink basis */
  flex: 0 1 auto; /* Default */
  flex: 1; /* Same as: 1 1 0 (grow equally) */
  flex: auto; /* Same as: 1 1 auto */
  flex: none; /* Same as: 0 0 auto (fixed size) */

  /* Override alignment for single item */
  align-self: center;
  align-self: flex-start;
  align-self: flex-end;

  /* Order (default is 0) */
  order: -1; /* Move to start */
  order: 1; /* Move to end */
}

/* COMMON PATTERNS */

/* Center everything (the holy grail) */
.center-all {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

/* Navigation bar */
.navbar {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

/* Card grid that wraps */
.card-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 20px;
}
.card {
  flex: 1 1 300px; /* Grow, shrink, min 300px */
  max-width: 400px;
}

/* Sticky footer layout */
.page {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
.main-content {
  flex: 1; /* Takes remaining space */
}
```

**Day 4-7: CSS Grid (2D Layout)**

```css
/*
   GRID is for TWO-DIMENSIONAL layout
   Rows AND columns at the same time
*/

/* CONTAINER (parent) */
.grid-container {
  display: grid; /* or inline-grid */

  /* Define columns */
  grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px; /* 3 equal columns */
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; /* 3 equal fractions */
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr; /* Middle is twice as wide */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* Same as 1fr 1fr 1fr */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr)); /* Responsive! */
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 100px; /* Fixed-flex-fixed */

  /* Define rows */
  grid-template-rows: 100px auto 50px; /* Header-content-footer */
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px); /* 3 rows of 100px */

  /* Implicit rows (when grid creates more rows) */
  grid-auto-rows: 100px;
  grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto); /* Min 100px, grow as needed */

  /* Gap */
  gap: 20px;
  row-gap: 10px;
  column-gap: 20px;

  /* Alignment (same as flexbox) */
  justify-items: start | end | center | stretch;
  align-items: start | end | center | stretch;
  justify-content: start | end | center | space-between | space-around;
  align-content: start | end | center | space-between | space-around;

  /* Named areas (powerful!) */
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header"
    "sidebar content content"
    "footer footer footer";
}

/* ITEMS (children) */
.grid-item {
  /* Position by line numbers */
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: 3; /* Spans columns 1-2 */
  grid-row-start: 1;
  grid-row-end: 2;

  /* Shorthand */
  grid-column: 1 / 3; /* Start / end */
  grid-row: 1 / 2;
  grid-column: 1 / span 2; /* Start / span count */
  grid-column: 1 / -1; /* Full width (-1 = last line) */

  /* Even shorter */
  grid-area: 1 / 1 / 2 / 3; /* row-start / col-start / row-end / col-end */

  /* Or use named areas */
  grid-area: header;
  grid-area: sidebar;
  grid-area: content;
  grid-area: footer;

  /* Self alignment */
  justify-self: start | end | center | stretch;
  align-self: start | end | center | stretch;
}

/* COMMON PATTERNS */

/* Responsive grid (no media queries!) */
.auto-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}

/* Classic page layout */
.page-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar content"
    "footer footer";
  grid-template-columns: 250px 1fr;

  width: 100%;
  padding: 0 16px;
}

.card-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr; /* Single column on mobile */
  gap: 16px;
}

/* Tablet and up */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    max-width: 720px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }

  .card-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); /* 2 columns */
  }
}

/* Desktop and up */

*/

/* Viewport units */
.hero {
  height: 100vh; /* 100% of viewport height */
  width: 100vw; /* 100% of viewport width */
  min-height: 100svh; /* Small viewport height (accounts for mobile browser UI) */
}

/* Responsive typography */
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 5vw, 3rem);
  /* clamp(minimum, preferred, maximum) */
  /* Scales between 1.5rem and 3rem based on viewport */
}

/* Responsive images */
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

/* Picture element for art direction */
/* (Different images for different screen sizes) */

/* Container queries (newer, powerful) */
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
  container-name: card;
}

@container card (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}
```

**Day 5-7: Transitions & Animations**

```css
/* Transitions (for state changes) */
.button {
  background: #3498db;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;

  /* Transition properties */
  transition-property: background, transform;
  transition-duration: 0.3s;
  transition-timing-function: ease;
  transition-delay: 0s;

  /* Shorthand */
  transition:
    background 0.3s ease,
    transform 0.2s ease;

  /* Transition all (careful - can be slow) */
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.button:hover {
  background: #2980b9;
  transform: translateY(-2px);
}

/* Timing functions */
/* ease       - slow start, fast middle, slow end (default) */
/* ease-in    - slow start */
/* ease-out   - slow end */
/* ease-in-out - slow start and end */
/* linear     - constant speed */
/* cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - custom */

/* Transforms */
.transform-examples {
  transform: translateX(50px); /* Move horizontally */
  transform: translateY(-20px); /* Move vertically */
  transform: translate(50px, -20px); /* Both */

  transform: rotate(45deg);
  transform: rotateX(45deg); /* 3D */
  transform: rotateY(45deg); /* 3D */

  transform: scale(1.2); /* 120% size */
  transform: scaleX(1.5);
  transform: scaleY(0.8);

  transform: skew(10deg, 5deg);

  /* Combine transforms */
  transform: translateX(50px) rotate(45deg) scale(1.1);

  /* Transform origin */
  transform-origin: center; /* Default */
  transform-origin: top left;
  transform-origin: 50% 100%;
}

/* Keyframe animations */
@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(20px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

/* Or with percentages */
@keyframes bounce {
  0%,
  100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  50% {
    transform: translateY(-20px);
  }
}

.animated-element {
  /* Animation properties */
  animation-name: fadeIn;
  animation-duration: 0.5s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-out;
  animation-delay: 0s;
  animation-iteration-count: 1; /* or infinite */
  animation-direction: normal; /* or reverse, alternate */
  animation-fill-mode: forwards; /* Keep final state */
  animation-play-state: running; /* or paused */

  /* Shorthand */
  animation: fadeIn 0.5s ease-out forwards;

  /* Multiple animations */
  animation:
    fadeIn 0.5s ease-out,
    bounce 1s ease-in-out 0.5s infinite;
}

/* Performance tips */
/* Only animate these properties for best performance: */
/* - transform */
/* - opacity */
/* Avoid animating: width, height, margin, padding, top, left */

.performant {
  /* Use will-change sparingly */
  will-change: transform;

  /* Use GPU acceleration */
  transform: translateZ(0);
}

/* Reduced motion preference (accessibility) */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

#### A1.3: JavaScript Fundamentals (Week 6-9)

> **Why this matters:** JavaScript is where programming actually begins. Everything before this was markup. If you don't understand JavaScript deeply, React will destroy you. Don't rush.

> **Time Investment:** ~3-4 hrs/day | **Total:** ~80 hours over 4 weeks

**What to Learn (In Order):**

**Week 6: Core Basics**

**Day 1: Variables & Types**

```javascript
// Variables - use const by default, let when needed
const name = "Rhythm"; // Cannot be reassigned
let age = 21; // Can be reassigned
// var is old, avoid it (function-scoped, hoisted, confusing)

// Primitive types
const string = "Hello"; // String
const number = 42; // Number (integers and floats)
const decimal = 3.14; // Also Number
const boolean = true; // Boolean (true/false)
const nothing = null; // Null (intentional absence)
let notDefined; // Undefined (not yet assigned)
const bigInt = 9007199254740991n; // BigInt (large numbers)
const symbol = Symbol("id"); // Symbol (unique identifier)

// typeof operator
console.log(typeof "hello"); // "string"
console.log(typeof 42); // "number"
console.log(typeof true); // "boolean"
console.log(typeof undefined); // "undefined"
console.log(typeof null); // "object" (famous JavaScript bug!)
console.log(typeof {}); // "object"
console.log(typeof []); // "object" (arrays are objects)
console.log(typeof function () {}); // "function"

// Type coercion (JavaScript converts types automatically - be careful!)
console.log("5" + 3); // "53" (string concatenation)
console.log("5" - 3); // 2 (subtraction converts to number)
console.log("5" * "2"); // 10
console.log(true + 1); // 2 (true = 1)
console.log(false + 1); // 1 (false = 0)
console.log("" == false); // true (loose equality)
console.log("" === false); // false (strict equality - use this!)

// Always use strict equality (===) to avoid confusion
```

**Day 2: Operators**

```javascript
// Arithmetic
let sum = 5 + 3; // 8
let diff = 5 - 3; // 2
let product = 5 * 3; // 15
let quotient = 5 / 3; // 1.666...
let remainder = 5 % 3; // 2 (modulo)
let power = 5 ** 3; // 125 (exponentiation)

// Increment / Decrement
let x = 5;
x++; // x is now 6 (postfix: returns old value, then increments)
++x; // x is now 7 (prefix: increments, then returns new value)
x--; // x is now 6
--x; // x is now 5

// Assignment
let a = 10;
a += 5; // a = a + 5 = 15
a -= 3; // a = a - 3 = 12
a *= 2; // a = a * 2 = 24
a /= 4; // a = a / 4 = 6
a %= 4; // a = a % 4 = 2

// Comparison (ALWAYS use === and !==)
console.log(5 === 5); // true (strict equality)
console.log(5 === "5"); // false (different types)
console.log(5 == "5"); // true (loose equality - avoid!)
console.log(5 !== 3); // true (strict inequality)
console.log(5 > 3); // true
console.log(5 < 3); // false
console.log(5 >= 5); // true
console.log(5 <= 4); // false

// Logical
console.log(true && false); // false (AND)
console.log(true || false); // true (OR)
console.log(!true); // false (NOT)

// Short-circuit evaluation
const result = null || "default"; // "default" (first truthy)
const result2 = "value" && "other"; // "other" (last truthy if all truthy)

// Nullish coalescing (??) - only checks null/undefined
const value = null ?? "default"; // "default"
const value2 = 0 ?? "default"; // 0 (0 is not null/undefined)
const value3 = 0 || "default"; // "default" (0 is falsy)

// Optional chaining (?.)
const user = { name: "Rhythm", address: { city: "Delhi" } };
console.log(user.address?.city); // "Delhi"
console.log(user.profile?.avatar); // undefined (no error!)

// Ternary operator
const status = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
```

**Day 3: Strings**

```javascript
// String creation
const single = "Hello";
const double = "World";
const template = `Hello ${name}!`; // Template literals (use these!)

// Template literals are powerful
const multiline = `
  This is
  a multiline
  string
`;

const expression = `Sum: ${2 + 2}`;
const nested = `Name: ${user.name.toUpperCase()}`;

// String properties and methods
const str = "Hello World";

str.length; // 11
str[0]; // "H" (first character)
str[str.length - 1]; // "d" (last character)

str.toUpperCase(); // "HELLO WORLD"
str.toLowerCase(); // "hello world"

str.indexOf("World"); // 6 (position, -1 if not found)
str.lastIndexOf("o"); // 7
str.includes("World"); // true
str.startsWith("Hello"); // true
str.endsWith("World"); // true

str.slice(0, 5); // "Hello" (start, end)
str.slice(6); // "World" (start to end)
str.slice(-5); // "World" (last 5 characters)
str.substring(0, 5); // "Hello" (similar to slice)

str.split(" "); // ["Hello", "World"]
str.split(""); // ["H","e","l","l","o"," ","W","o","r","l","d"]
["Hello", "World"].join(" "); // "Hello World"

str.trim(); // Remove whitespace from both ends
str.trimStart(); // Remove from start
str.trimEnd(); // Remove from end

str.replace("World", "JS"); // "Hello JS" (first occurrence)
str.replaceAll("o", "0"); // "Hell0 W0rld" (all occurrences)

str.repeat(3); // "Hello WorldHello WorldHello World"

str.padStart(15, "*"); // "****Hello World"
str.padEnd(15, "*"); // "Hello World****"

// String is immutable - methods return new strings
const original = "hello";
const upper = original.toUpperCase();
console.log(original); // "hello" (unchanged)
console.log(upper); // "HELLO"
```

**Day 4-5: Numbers & Math**

```javascript
// Number creation
const int = 42;
const float = 3.14;
const negative = -10;
const exponential = 2.5e6; // 2,500,000

// Special values
const inf = Infinity;
const negInf = -Infinity;
const notANumber = NaN;

// Checking special values
Number.isNaN(NaN); // true
Number.isNaN("hello"); // false (doesn't coerce)
isNaN("hello"); // true (coerces - avoid!)
Number.isFinite(42); // true
Number.isFinite(Infinity); // false
Number.isInteger(42); // true
Number.isInteger(42.5); // false

// Parsing strings to numbers
parseInt("42"); // 42
parseInt("42.5"); // 42 (truncates)
parseInt("42px"); // 42 (ignores trailing non-digits)
parseInt("abc"); // NaN
parseInt("101", 2); // 5 (binary)
parseFloat("3.14"); // 3.14
parseFloat("3.14abc"); // 3.14
Number("42"); // 42
Number("42abc"); // NaN (stricter)
+"42"; // 42 (unary plus, quick conversion)

// Number methods
const num = 3.14159;
num.toFixed(2); // "3.14" (string!)
num.toPrecision(4); // "3.142" (string!)
num.toString(); // "3.14159"
num.toString(2); // Binary representation

// Math object
Math.PI; // 3.141592653589793
Math.E; // 2.718281828459045

Math.round(4.5); // 5 (round to nearest)
Math.floor(4.9); // 4 (round down)
Math.ceil(4.1); // 5 (round up)
Math.trunc(4.9); // 4 (remove decimals)

Math.abs(-5); // 5 (absolute value)
Math.sign(-5); // -1 (-1, 0, or 1)

Math.max(1, 5, 3); // 5
Math.min(1, 5, 3); // 1
Math.max(...[1, 5, 3]); // 5 (with array spread)

Math.pow(2, 3); // 8 (or use 2 ** 3)
Math.sqrt(16); // 4
Math.cbrt(27); // 3 (cube root)

Math.random(); // 0 to 0.999...
Math.floor(Math.random() * 10); // 0 to 9
Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min; // min to max

// Floating point issues (famous!)
console.log(0.1 + 0.2); // 0.30000000000000004 (not 0.3!)
// Solution: use integers (cents instead of dollars) or libraries
```

**Day 6-7: Control Flow**

```javascript
// If/else
if (condition) {
  // code
} else if (otherCondition) {
  // code
} else {
  // code
}

// Truthy and Falsy values (MEMORIZE THESE!)
// Falsy: false, 0, -0, 0n, "", null, undefined, NaN
// Everything else is truthy (including [], {}, "0", "false")

if ("") console.log("truthy"); // Doesn't run (empty string is falsy)
if ("0") console.log("truthy"); // Runs ("0" is truthy!)
if ([]) console.log("truthy"); // Runs (empty array is truthy!)
if ({}) console.log("truthy"); // Runs (empty object is truthy!)

// Switch
switch (value) {
  case 1:
    console.log("One");
    break; // Don't forget break!
  case 2:
  case 3:
    console.log("Two or Three"); // Fall-through
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Other");
}

// Ternary (for simple conditions)
const message = isLoggedIn ? "Welcome back!" : "Please log in";

// Loops
// For loop (when you know the count)
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// While loop (when you don't know the count)
while (condition) {
  // code
  // Make sure condition eventually becomes false!
}

// Do-while (runs at least once)
do {
  // code
} while (condition);

// For...of (for iterables: arrays, strings, etc.)
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
for (const fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit);
}

for (const char of "Hello") {
  console.log(char);
}

// For...in (for object properties - rarely use for arrays)
const person = { name: "Rhythm", age: 21 };
for (const key in person) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
}

// Break and continue
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) break; // Exit loop entirely
  if (i === 3) continue; // Skip this iteration
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 4
}

// Labeled statements (rare, but useful for nested loops)
outer: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    if (i === 1 && j === 1) break outer; // Breaks both loops
    console.log(i, j);
  }
}
```

**Day 7: Functions**

```javascript
// Function declaration (hoisted - can be called before definition)
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Function expression (not hoisted)
const greet2 = function (name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

// Arrow function (modern, preferred for most cases)
const greet3 = (name) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

// Arrow function shortcuts
const greet4 = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`; // Implicit return
const double = (x) => x * 2; // Single param, no parens needed
const getObject = () => ({ key: "value" }); // Return object (wrap in parens)

// Parameters
function example(required, optional = "default") {
  console.log(required, optional);
}
example("a"); // "a" "default"
example("a", "b"); // "a" "b"

// Rest parameters (collect remaining arguments)
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
sum(1, 2, 3, 4); // 10

// Spread operator (expand array into arguments)
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(Math.max(...nums)); // 3

// Return values
function noReturn() {
  console.log("No return");
  // Implicitly returns undefined
}

function earlyReturn(x) {
  if (x < 0) return "Negative"; // Early return
  return "Non-negative";
}

// Functions are first-class citizens (can be passed around)
const operations = {
  add: (a, b) => a + b,
  subtract: (a, b) => a - b,
};

function calculate(a, b, operation) {
  return operation(a, b);
}
calculate(5, 3, operations.add); // 8

// IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
(function () {
  console.log("Runs immediately!");
})();

// Arrow functions and 'this' (important difference!)
// Arrow functions don't have their own 'this'
// They inherit 'this' from the surrounding scope
// More on this later...
```

**Week 7: Intermediate Concepts**

**Day 1-2: Arrays**

```javascript
// Array creation
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const arr2 = new Array(5); // [empty × 5]
const arr3 = Array.from("hello"); // ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
const arr4 = Array.from({ length: 5 }, (_, i) => i); // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

// Accessing elements
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
fruits[0]; // "apple"
fruits[fruits.length - 1]; // "cherry" (last element)
fruits.at(-1); // "cherry" (modern way)
fruits.at(-2); // "banana"

// Checking
Array.isArray(fruits); // true
fruits.includes("banana"); // true
fruits.indexOf("banana"); // 1 (-1 if not found)
fruits.lastIndexOf("a"); // ... finds from end

// Mutating methods (change the original array)
fruits.push("date"); // Add to end, returns new length
fruits.pop(); // Remove from end, returns removed element
fruits.unshift("avocado"); // Add to start
fruits.shift(); // Remove from start
fruits.splice(1, 1); // Remove 1 element at index 1
fruits.splice(1, 0, "blueberry"); // Insert at index 1
fruits.splice(1, 1, "blackberry"); // Replace at index 1
fruits.reverse(); // Reverse in place
fruits.sort(); // Sort in place (alphabetically by default)
fruits.fill("x"); // Fill with value

// Sort with custom compare function
const numbers = [10, 2, 30, 4];
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b); // [2, 4, 10, 30] (ascending)
numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a); // [30, 10, 4, 2] (descending)

// Non-mutating methods (return new array)
const doubled = numbers.map((n) => n * 2);
const evens = numbers.filter((n) => n % 2 === 0);
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);
const product = numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc * n, 1);

// Very important methods to master:
// map - transform each element
[1, 2, 3].map((x) => x * 2); // [2, 4, 6]

// filter - keep elements that pass test
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].filter((x) => x > 2); // [3, 4, 5]

// reduce - combine into single value
[1, 2, 3, 4].reduce((sum, x) => sum + x, 0); // 10

// find - first element that passes test
[1, 2, 3, 4].find((x) => x > 2); // 3

// findIndex - index of first element that passes test
[1, 2, 3, 4].findIndex((x) => x > 2); // 2

// some - do ANY elements pass test?
[1, 2, 3].some((x) => x > 2); // true

// every - do ALL elements pass test?
[1, 2, 3].every((x) => x > 0); // true

// forEach - just loop (no return value, avoid when possible)
[1, 2, 3].forEach((x) => console.log(x));

// Other useful methods
[1, 2, 3].slice(1, 2); // [2] (doesn't mutate)
[1, 2].concat([3, 4]); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
[
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4],
].flat(); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3].flatMap((x) => [x, x * 2]); // [1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 6]
[1, 2, 3].join("-"); // "1-2-3"

// Spread operator
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const copy = [...arr]; // Shallow copy
const merged = [...arr, 4, 5]; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const combined = [...arr1, ...arr2]; // Combine arrays

// Destructuring
const [first, second, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// first = 1, second = 2, rest = [3, 4, 5]

const [a, , c] = [1, 2, 3]; // Skip elements
// a = 1, c = 3
```

**Day 3-4: Objects**

```javascript
// Object creation
const person = {
  name: "Rhythm",
  age: 21,
  isStudent: true,
  hobbies: ["coding", "badminton"],
  address: {
    city: "Delhi",
    country: "India",
  },
  // Method (function inside object)
  greet() {
    return `Hello, I'm ${this.name}`;
  },
  // Computed property name
  ["dynamic" + "Key"]: "value",
};

// Accessing properties
person.name; // "Rhythm" (dot notation)
person["name"]; // "Rhythm" (bracket notation)
const key = "age";
person[key]; // 21 (dynamic key access)
person.address.city; // "Delhi" (nested)
person?.address?.city; // "Delhi" (optional chaining - safe)
person?.phone?.number; // undefined (no error if phone doesn't exist)

// Modifying
person.name = "New Name"; // Update
person.email = "a@b.com"; // Add new property
delete person.isStudent; // Remove property

// Checking properties
"name" in person; // true
person.hasOwnProperty("name"); // true
Object.hasOwn(person, "name"); // true (modern)

// Object methods
Object.keys(person); // ["name", "age", ...] (array of keys)
Object.values(person); // ["Rhythm", 21, ...] (array of values)
Object.entries(person); // [["name", "Rhythm"], ["age", 21], ...]

// Looping over objects
for (const key in person) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
}

for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(person)) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}

// Object spread (shallow copy)
const copy = { ...person };
const merged = { ...person, ...otherObj };
const withUpdates = { ...person, age: 22 };

// Object destructuring
const { name, age } = person;
const { name: userName, age: userAge } = person; // Rename
const {
  name,
  address: { city },
} = person; // Nested
const { name, phone = "N/A" } = person; // Default value

// Shorthand property names
const x = 10,
  y = 20;
const point = { x, y }; // Same as { x: x, y: y }

// Object.assign (older way to copy/merge)
const copy2 = Object.assign({}, person);
const merged2 = Object.assign({}, person, otherObj);

// Object.freeze (make immutable)
const frozen = Object.freeze({ a: 1, b: 2 });
frozen.a = 100; // Silently fails (or throws in strict mode)
console.log(frozen.a); // Still 1

// Object.seal (can modify, but can't add/remove properties)
const sealed = Object.seal({ a: 1, b: 2 });
sealed.a = 100; // Works
sealed.c = 3; // Silently fails
```

**Day 5-6: Scope & Closures**

```javascript
// SCOPE - where variables are accessible

// Global scope
const globalVar = "I'm global";

function example() {
  // Function scope
  const functionVar = "I'm in a function";

  if (true) {
    // Block scope
    const blockVar = "I'm in a block";
    let alsoBlock = "Me too";
    var notBlock = "I'm function-scoped!"; // var ignores blocks!
  }

  console.log(notBlock); // Works (var is function-scoped)
  // console.log(blockVar); // Error (const is block-scoped)
}

// HOISTING - declarations are "moved" to top of scope
console.log(hoistedVar); // undefined (not an error!)
var hoistedVar = "hello";

// console.log(notHoisted);  // Error: Cannot access before initialization
let notHoisted = "hello";
const alsoNotHoisted = "hello";

// Function declarations are fully hoisted
sayHello(); // Works!
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

// Function expressions are not hoisted
// sayGoodbye();  // Error!
const sayGoodbye = function () {
  console.log("Goodbye!");
};

// CLOSURES - functions "remember" their scope

function createCounter() {
  let count = 0; // Private variable

  return {
    increment() {
      count++;
      return count;
    },
    decrement() {
      count--;
      return count;
    },
    getCount() {
      return count;
    },
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter.increment(); // 1
counter.increment(); // 2
counter.getCount(); // 2
// count is not accessible directly, only through the returned functions

// Closure example: creating functions with "memory"
function createMultiplier(factor) {
  return function (number) {
    return number * factor; // "Remembers" factor
  };
}

const double = createMultiplier(2);
const triple = createMultiplier(3);
double(5); // 10
triple(5); // 15

// Common closure gotcha with var in loops
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
// Prints: 3, 3, 3 (not 0, 1, 2!)

// Fix with let (block-scoped)
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
// Prints: 0, 1, 2

// Or fix with IIFE
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  ((j) => {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(j), 1000);
  })(i);
}
// Prints: 0, 1, 2
```

**Day 7: Higher-Order Functions**

```javascript
// Higher-order function: takes or returns a function

// Taking a function as argument
function doTwice(fn) {
  fn();
  fn();
}

doTwice(() => console.log("Hello!"));

// Returning a function
function createGreeter(greeting) {
  return function (name) {
    return `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
  };
}

const sayHello = createGreeter("Hello");
const sayHi = createGreeter("Hi");

sayHello("Rhythm"); // "Hello, Rhythm!"
sayHi("World"); // "Hi, World!"

// Practical examples with array methods
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// map with callback
const doubled = numbers.map(function (num) {
  return num * 2;
});

// Same with arrow function
const tripled = numbers.map((num) => num * 3);

// filter
const evens = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);

// reduce
const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, current) => {
  return accumulator + current;
}, 0);

// Chaining
const result = numbers
  .filter((n) => n > 2)
  .map((n) => n * 2)
  .reduce((sum, n) => sum + n, 0);
// [3, 4, 5] -> [6, 8, 10] -> 24

// Custom higher-order function
function unless(condition, fn) {
  if (!condition) {
    fn();
  }
}

unless(false, () => console.log("This runs!"));

// Debounce (common utility)
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timeoutId;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}

// Throttle (common utility)
function throttle(fn, limit) {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return function (...args) {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastCall >= limit) {
      lastCall = now;
      fn.apply(this, args);
    }
  };
}

// Usage
const debouncedSearch = debounce((query) => {
  console.log(`Searching for: ${query}`);
}, 300);
```

This covers the first half of JavaScript Fundamentals. The content continues with Week 8 (Asynchronous JavaScript) and Week 9 (DOM & Browser APIs), but I'll include those in the next part to keep this section manageable.

#### A1.3: JavaScript Fundamentals (Continued)

**Week 8: Asynchronous JavaScript**

> This is where most beginners get confused. Take your time. Understand how JavaScript handles async operations.

**Day 1: Understanding Async**

```javascript
// JavaScript is SINGLE-THREADED
// Only one thing can execute at a time

// But it's also NON-BLOCKING
// Long operations don't freeze the program

// How? The EVENT LOOP

console.log("1. First");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("2. Timeout callback");
}, 0); // Even 0ms delay!

console.log("3. Second");

// Output:
// 1. First
// 3. Second
// 2. Timeout callback

// Why? setTimeout is async - it goes to the callback queue
// and waits for the call stack to be empty

/*
THE EVENT LOOP:

1. Call Stack - where functions execute (one at a time)
2. Web APIs - browser handles async operations (setTimeout, fetch, etc.)
3. Callback Queue - callbacks waiting to be executed
4. Event Loop - checks if call stack is empty, then moves callbacks from queue

When you call setTimeout:
1. setTimeout is added to call stack
2. setTimeout registers callback with Web API
3. setTimeout is removed from call stack
4. After delay, callback moves to queue
5. Event loop waits for call stack to be empty
6. Callback is moved to call stack and executed
*/

// Callbacks (the old way)
function fetchUserData(userId, callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const user = { id: userId, name: "Rhythm" };
    callback(user);
  }, 1000);
}

fetchUserData(1, (user) => {
  console.log(user);
});

// Callback Hell (why we needed something better)
fetchUserData(1, (user) => {
  fetchUserPosts(user.id, (posts) => {
    fetchComments(posts[0].id, (comments) => {
      fetchReplies(comments[0].id, (replies) => {
        // This is a nightmare to read and maintain
      });
    });
  });
});
```

**Day 2-3: Promises**

```javascript
// A Promise represents a future value
// States: pending -> fulfilled OR rejected

// Creating a Promise
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Async operation here
  setTimeout(() => {
    const success = true;
    if (success) {
      resolve("Data fetched!"); // Fulfilled
    } else {
      reject(new Error("Failed to fetch")); // Rejected
    }
  }, 1000);
});

// Consuming a Promise
promise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // "Data fetched!"
    return "Next value"; // Passes to next .then
  })
  .then((nextResult) => {
    console.log(nextResult); // "Next value"
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); // Handles any error in the chain
  })
  .finally(() => {
    console.log("Always runs"); // Cleanup
  });

// Practical example: wrapping callback in Promise
function delay(ms) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(resolve, ms);
  });
}

delay(1000).then(() => console.log("1 second passed"));

// Fetch API returns a Promise
fetch("https://api.example.com/users")
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.json(); // Also returns a Promise!
  })
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Fetch failed:", error);
  });

// Chaining Promises (solving callback hell)
fetchUserData(1)
  .then((user) => fetchUserPosts(user.id))
  .then((posts) => fetchComments(posts[0].id))
  .then((comments) => fetchReplies(comments[0].id))
  .then((replies) => console.log(replies))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));

// Promise static methods

// Promise.all - wait for ALL promises (fails fast on first rejection)
const promises = [
  fetch("/api/users"),
  fetch("/api/posts"),
  fetch("/api/comments"),
];

Promise.all(promises)
  .then((responses) => {
    console.log("All fetched:", responses);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("One failed:", error);
  });

// Promise.allSettled - wait for ALL, get all results (no fail-fast)
Promise.allSettled(promises).then((results) => {
  results.forEach((result) => {
    if (result.status === "fulfilled") {
      console.log("Success:", result.value);
    } else {
      console.log("Failed:", result.reason);
    }
  });
});

// Promise.race - first to settle wins
Promise.race([
  fetch("/api/fast"),
  fetch("/api/slow"),
  new Promise((_, reject) =>
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Timeout")), 5000),
  ),
])
  .then((first) => console.log("Winner:", first))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));

// Promise.any - first to FULFILL wins (ignores rejections)
Promise.any([
  fetch("/api/server1"),
  fetch("/api/server2"),
  fetch("/api/server3"),
])
  .then((first) => console.log("First success:", first))
  .catch((error) => console.error("All failed:", error));
```

**Day 4-5: Async/Await**

```javascript
// Async/await is syntactic sugar over Promises
// Makes async code look synchronous

// Async function always returns a Promise
async function getData() {
  return "Hello"; // Wrapped in Promise.resolve()
}

getData().then(console.log); // "Hello"

// Await pauses execution until Promise resolves
async function fetchUser() {
  const response = await fetch("/api/user"); // Waits here
  const data = await response.json(); // Then waits here
  return data;
}

// Error handling with try/catch
async function fetchUserSafe() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("/api/user");

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Fetch failed:", error);
    throw error; // Re-throw or return default value
  }
}

// Sequential vs Parallel

// Sequential (slow - each waits for previous)
async function sequential() {
  const user = await fetchUser(); // Wait
  const posts = await fetchPosts(user.id); // Then wait
  const comments = await fetchComments(posts[0].id); // Then wait
  return { user, posts, comments };
}

// Parallel (fast - all at once)
async function parallel() {
  const [users, posts, comments] = await Promise.all([
    fetchUsers(),
    fetchPosts(),
    fetchComments(),
  ]);
  return { users, posts, comments };
}

// Start parallel, await later
async function parallelBetter() {
  // Start both immediately
  const usersPromise = fetchUsers();
  const postsPromise = fetchPosts();

  // Do other stuff...

  // Now wait for both
  const users = await usersPromise;
  const posts = await postsPromise;

  return { users, posts };
}

// Async in loops - be careful!

// WRONG - sequential (slow)
async function processSequential(items) {
  const results = [];
  for (const item of items) {
    const result = await processItem(item); // Waits each time
    results.push(result);
  }
  return results;
}

// RIGHT - parallel (fast)
async function processParallel(items) {
  const results = await Promise.all(items.map((item) => processItem(item)));
  return results;
}

// Sometimes sequential is correct (rate limiting, dependencies)
async function processSequentialCorrect(items) {
  const results = [];
  for (const item of items) {
    // Each iteration depends on previous
    const result = await processWithPreviousResult(item, results);
    results.push(result);
  }
  return results;
}

// Async IIFE
(async () => {
  const data = await fetchData();
  console.log(data);
})();

// Top-level await (in modules)
// const data = await fetchData();  // Works in ES modules
```

**Day 6: Modules**

```javascript
// ES Modules (ESM) - the modern standard

// Exporting

// Named exports (multiple per file)
// math.js
export const PI = 3.14159;
export function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
export function subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
}

// Or export at the end
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
const divide = (a, b) => a / b;
export { multiply, divide };

// Default export (one per file)
// User.js
export default class User {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

// Mixed exports
export default function main() {}
export const helper = () => {};

// Importing

// Named imports (must match export names)
import { add, subtract } from './math.js';
import { add as addition } from './math.js';  // Rename
import * as math from './math.js';  // Import all as namespace
math.add(1, 2);
math.PI;

// Default import (can use any name)
import User from './User.js';
import MyUser from './User.js';  // Same thing

// Mixed
import User, { helper } from './User.js';

// Side-effect import (just runs the module)
import './analytics.js';

// Dynamic import (code splitting, lazy loading)
async function loadModule() {
    const module = await import('./heavy-module.js');
    module.doSomething();
}

// Conditional import
if (condition) {
    const { feature } = await import('./feature.js');
    feature();
}

// Re-exporting
// index.js (barrel file)
export { add, subtract } from './math.js';
export { default as User } from './User.js';
export * from './utils.js';  // Re-export everything
```

**Day 7: Error Handling**

```javascript
// Types of errors
// SyntaxError - code can't be parsed
// ReferenceError - variable doesn't exist
// TypeError - wrong type operation
// RangeError - value out of range

// Throwing errors
function divide(a, b) {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero");
  }
  return a / b;
}

// Custom errors
class ValidationError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "ValidationError";
  }
}

class NotFoundError extends Error {
  constructor(resource) {
    super(`${resource} not found`);
    this.name = "NotFoundError";
    this.resource = resource;
  }
}

// Using custom errors
function findUser(id) {
  const user = database.find((u) => u.id === id);
  if (!user) {
    throw new NotFoundError("User");
  }
  return user;
}

// Try/catch/finally
try {
  const result = riskyOperation();
  console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    console.error("Validation failed:", error.message);
  } else if (error instanceof NotFoundError) {
    console.error("Not found:", error.resource);
  } else {
    console.error("Unknown error:", error);
    throw error; // Re-throw unexpected errors
  }
} finally {
  // Always runs (cleanup)
  cleanup();
}

// Error handling in async code
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.name === "AbortError") {
      console.log("Request cancelled");
    } else {
      console.error("Fetch failed:", error);
    }
    throw error; // Re-throw for caller to handle
  }
}

// Catching unhandled Promise rejections
window.addEventListener("unhandledrejection", (event) => {
  console.error("Unhandled rejection:", event.reason);
  // Log to error tracking service
});

// Catching all errors
window.addEventListener("error", (event) => {
  console.error("Global error:", event.error);
  // Log to error tracking service
});
```

**Week 9: DOM & Browser APIs**

**Day 1-2: DOM Selection & Traversal**

```javascript
// The DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree representation of your HTML
// JavaScript can read and modify it

// Selecting elements

// By ID (returns single element or null)
const header = document.getElementById("header");

// By CSS selector (returns first match or null)
const firstButton = document.querySelector(".btn");
const submitBtn = document.querySelector('button[type="submit"]');
const nav = document.querySelector("nav > ul");

// All matches (returns NodeList)
const allButtons = document.querySelectorAll(".btn");
const allLinks = document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="https"]');

// NodeList is array-like but not an array
// Convert to array if needed:
const buttonsArray = Array.from(allButtons);
const buttonsArray2 = [...allButtons];

// Loop over NodeList
allButtons.forEach((btn) => {
  console.log(btn.textContent);
});

// Older methods (still work, but querySelector is preferred)
const byClass = document.getElementsByClassName("btn"); // HTMLCollection
const byTag = document.getElementsByTagName("p"); // HTMLCollection
// HTMLCollection is live (updates when DOM changes)
// NodeList from querySelectorAll is static

// Traversing the DOM

const element = document.querySelector(".item");

// Parent
element.parentNode; // Direct parent
element.parentElement; // Direct parent (element only)
element.closest(".container"); // Nearest ancestor matching selector

// Children
element.children; // HTMLCollection of child elements
element.childNodes; // NodeList including text nodes
element.firstChild; // First child (including text)
element.firstElementChild; // First child element
element.lastChild; // Last child (including text)
element.lastElementChild; // Last child element

// Siblings
element.previousSibling; // Previous (including text)
element.previousElementSibling; // Previous element
element.nextSibling; // Next (including text)
element.nextElementSibling; // Next element

// Checking relationships
parent.contains(child); // Is child inside parent?
element.matches(".active"); // Does element match selector?
```

**Day 3: DOM Manipulation**

```javascript
// Reading and modifying content

const element = document.querySelector(".item");

// Text content (just text, no HTML)
element.textContent; // Get text
element.textContent = "New text"; // Set text (escapes HTML)

// HTML content (includes HTML tags)
element.innerHTML; // Get HTML
element.innerHTML = "<strong>Bold</strong>"; // Set HTML
// WARNING: innerHTML with user input = XSS vulnerability!
element.innerHTML = userInput; // DANGEROUS!
element.textContent = userInput; // SAFE (escapes HTML)

// Outer HTML (includes the element itself)
element.outerHTML;
element.outerHTML = "<div>Replaced!</div>";

// Attributes
element.getAttribute("href");
element.setAttribute("href", "https://example.com");
element.removeAttribute("disabled");
element.hasAttribute("data-id");

// Data attributes
// HTML: <div data-user-id="123" data-active="true">
element.dataset.userId; // "123"
element.dataset.active; // "true"
element.dataset.newAttr = "value"; // Sets data-new-attr

// Classes
element.className; // Get/set class string
element.classList.add("active");
element.classList.remove("active");
element.classList.toggle("active");
element.classList.toggle("active", condition); // Force add/remove
element.classList.contains("active"); // Returns boolean
element.classList.replace("old", "new");

// Styles
element.style.color = "red";
element.style.backgroundColor = "blue"; // camelCase!
element.style.cssText = "color: red; background: blue;";

// Get computed styles (actual rendered styles)
const styles = getComputedStyle(element);
styles.color; // "rgb(255, 0, 0)"

// Creating elements
const div = document.createElement("div");
div.className = "card";
div.textContent = "Hello";

const link = document.createElement("a");
link.href = "https://example.com";
link.textContent = "Click me";

// Adding elements to DOM
parent.appendChild(child); // Add as last child
parent.prepend(child); // Add as first child
parent.append(child1, child2); // Add multiple at end
parent.insertBefore(newNode, referenceNode);
element.before(newElement); // Insert before
element.after(newElement); // Insert after

// Safer HTML insertion
element.insertAdjacentHTML("beforebegin", "<p>Before</p>"); // Before element
element.insertAdjacentHTML("afterbegin", "<p>Start</p>"); // First child
element.insertAdjacentHTML("beforeend", "<p>End</p>"); // Last child
element.insertAdjacentHTML("afterend", "<p>After</p>"); // After element

// Removing elements
element.remove(); // Remove from DOM
parent.removeChild(child); // Old way

// Cloning
const clone = element.cloneNode(false); // Shallow (just element)
const deepClone = element.cloneNode(true); // Deep (with children)

// Replacing
parent.replaceChild(newChild, oldChild);
oldElement.replaceWith(newElement);
```

**Day 4-5: Events**

```javascript
// Adding event listeners
const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  console.log("Clicked!", event);
});

// Arrow function (shorter, but 'this' behaves differently)
button.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  console.log("Clicked!", e.target);
});

// Named function (can be removed later)
function handleClick(event) {
  console.log("Clicked!");
}
button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
button.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);

// The event object
button.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  event.target; // Element that triggered event
  event.currentTarget; // Element listener is attached to
  event.type; // "click"
  event.timeStamp; // When it happened

  // For mouse events
  event.clientX; // X position relative to viewport
  event.clientY; // Y position relative to viewport
  event.pageX; // X position relative to document
  event.pageY; // Y position relative to document
  event.button; // Which mouse button (0=left, 1=middle, 2=right)

  // For keyboard events
  event.key; // The key pressed ("Enter", "a", "Escape")
  event.code; // Physical key ("Enter", "KeyA", "Escape")
  event.ctrlKey; // Was Ctrl held?
  event.shiftKey; // Was Shift held?
  event.altKey; // Was Alt held?
  event.metaKey; // Was Cmd/Win held?

  // Methods
  event.preventDefault(); // Prevent default action
  event.stopPropagation(); // Stop bubbling
});

// Common events
// Mouse: click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseup, mousemove, mouseenter, mouseleave
// Keyboard: keydown, keyup, keypress (deprecated)
// Form: submit, change, input, focus, blur
// Window: load, DOMContentLoaded, resize, scroll
// Touch: touchstart, touchend, touchmove

// Event bubbling and capturing
/*
When you click a button inside a div inside body:
1. Capturing phase: window → document → body → div → button (down)
2. Target phase: button
3. Bubbling phase: button → div → body → document → window (up)
*/

// By default, listeners run in bubbling phase
parent.addEventListener("click", () => console.log("Parent"));
child.addEventListener("click", () => console.log("Child"));
// Click on child: "Child" then "Parent" (bubbles up)

// Capture phase (third argument true)
parent.addEventListener("click", () => console.log("Parent"), true);
// Click on child: "Parent" (capture) then "Child" (bubble)

// Stop propagation
child.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  e.stopPropagation(); // Parent listener won't run
  console.log("Child only");
});

// Prevent default behavior
const link = document.querySelector("a");
link.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // Don't navigate
  console.log("Link clicked but not followed");
});

const form = document.querySelector("form");
form.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // Don't submit
  // Handle form with JavaScript instead
});

// EVENT DELEGATION (very important pattern!)
// Instead of attaching listeners to many elements,
// attach one listener to a parent

// BAD: listener on each button
document.querySelectorAll(".btn").forEach((btn) => {
  btn.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
});

// GOOD: one listener on parent
document.querySelector(".button-container").addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  if (e.target.matches(".btn")) {
    handleClick(e);
  }
});

// Benefits of delegation:
// - Works for dynamically added elements
// - Uses less memory
// - Easier to manage

// Practical example: todo list
const todoList = document.querySelector(".todo-list");

todoList.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  // Delete button clicked
  if (e.target.matches(".delete-btn")) {
    const todoItem = e.target.closest(".todo-item");
    todoItem.remove();
  }

  // Checkbox clicked
  if (e.target.matches(".todo-checkbox")) {
    const todoItem = e.target.closest(".todo-item");
    todoItem.classList.toggle("completed");
  }
});

// Once option (listener runs once then removes itself)
button.addEventListener("click", handleClick, { once: true });

// Passive option (for scroll performance)
window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll, { passive: true });
```

**Day 6: Forms**

```javascript
// Accessing form elements
const form = document.querySelector("form");

// By name attribute
form.elements.username; // Input with name="username"
form.elements["email"]; // Input with name="email"

// Getting values
const input = document.querySelector("input");
input.value; // Current value
input.defaultValue; // Original value

// Checkboxes and radios
const checkbox = document.querySelector('input[type="checkbox"]');
checkbox.checked; // true or false

// Select dropdowns
const select = document.querySelector("select");
select.value; // Selected option's value
select.selectedIndex; // Index of selected option
select.options; // All options
select.options[select.selectedIndex].text; // Selected option's text

// Multiple select
const multiSelect = document.querySelector("select[multiple]");
const selected = Array.from(multiSelect.selectedOptions).map((o) => o.value);

// Form submission
form.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  // Get all form data
  const formData = new FormData(form);

  // Access values
  const username = formData.get("username");
  const email = formData.get("email");

  // Convert to object
  const data = Object.fromEntries(formData);

  // Or iterate
  for (const [key, value] of formData) {
    console.log(key, value);
  }

  // Send to server
  fetch("/api/submit", {
    method: "POST",
    body: formData, // FormData can be sent directly
  });

  // Or send as JSON
  fetch("/api/submit", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  });
});

// Input validation
const emailInput = document.querySelector('input[type="email"]');

emailInput.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
  if (emailInput.validity.valid) {
    emailInput.classList.remove("error");
  } else {
    emailInput.classList.add("error");
  }
});

// Validity API
input.validity.valid; // Is valid?
input.validity.valueMissing; // Required but empty?
input.validity.typeMismatch; // Wrong type (email, url)?
input.validity.patternMismatch; // Doesn't match pattern?
input.validity.tooShort; // Shorter than minlength?
input.validity.tooLong; // Longer than maxlength?
input.validity.rangeUnderflow; // Less than min?
input.validity.rangeOverflow; // Greater than max?

// Custom validation
input.setCustomValidity("Custom error message");
input.setCustomValidity(""); // Clear custom error

// Check validity
form.checkValidity(); // Returns boolean
form.reportValidity(); // Shows validation UI
```

**Day 7: Browser APIs**

```javascript
// Local Storage (persists across sessions)
localStorage.setItem("username", "Rhythm");
const username = localStorage.getItem("username");
localStorage.removeItem("username");
localStorage.clear(); // Remove all

// Store objects (must stringify)
const user = { name: "Rhythm", age: 21 };
localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(user));
const stored = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"));

// Session Storage (cleared when tab closes)
sessionStorage.setItem("tempData", "value");
sessionStorage.getItem("tempData");

// Fetch API
async function fetchData() {
  // GET request
  const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  const data = await response.json();

  // POST request
  const postResponse = await fetch("https://api.example.com/users", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: "Bearer token123",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ name: "Rhythm", email: "r@r.com" }),
  });

  // Check if successful
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
  }

  return data;
}

// Response methods
response.json(); // Parse as JSON
response.text(); // Parse as text
response.blob(); // Parse as binary
response.formData(); // Parse as FormData

// Abort fetch
const controller = new AbortController();

fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal })
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .catch((error) => {
    if (error.name === "AbortError") {
      console.log("Fetch cancelled");
    }
  });

// Cancel after 5 seconds
setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 5000);

// URL API
const url = new URL("https://example.com/path?name=value");
url.searchParams.get("name"); // "value"
url.searchParams.set("name", "new");
url.searchParams.append("other", "value");
url.toString(); // Full URL string

// History API
history.pushState({ page: 1 }, "Title", "/page1"); // Add to history
history.replaceState({ page: 2 }, "Title", "/page2"); // Replace current
history.back(); // Go back
history.forward(); // Go forward
history.go(-2); // Go back 2 pages

window.addEventListener("popstate", (event) => {
  console.log("Navigation:", event.state);
});

// Location
window.location.href; // Full URL
window.location.origin; // Protocol + host
window.location.pathname; // Path
window.location.search; // Query string
window.location.hash; // Hash fragment
window.location.reload(); // Reload page
window.location.assign(url); // Navigate (adds to history)
window.location.replace(url); // Navigate (no history)

// Timers
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Runs once after 1 second");
}, 1000);
clearTimeout(timeoutId); // Cancel

const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
  console.log("Runs every 1 second");
}, 1000);
clearInterval(intervalId); // Cancel

// requestAnimationFrame (for animations)
function animate() {
  // Update animation
  element.style.left = x + "px";

  if (!done) {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  }
}
requestAnimationFrame(animate);

// IntersectionObserver (detect when element is visible)
const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
  (entries) => {
    entries.forEach((entry) => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        entry.target.classList.add("visible");
        observer.unobserve(entry.target); // Stop observing
      }
    });
  },
  {
    threshold: 0.5, // 50% visible
  },
);

document.querySelectorAll(".lazy-load").forEach((el) => {
  observer.observe(el);
});
```

### Month 3-4: Advanced JavaScript & TypeScript

#### A2.1: Advanced JavaScript (Week 10-11)

> **Why this matters:** Prototypes, classes, design patterns — this is what separates juniors from mid-level developers. Interviewers love asking about these.

> **Time Investment:** ~3 hrs/day | **Total:** ~30 hours over 2 weeks

**Week 10: Prototypes & Classes**

```javascript
// PROTOTYPES - JavaScript's inheritance mechanism

// Every object has a prototype (hidden [[Prototype]] property)
const obj = { name: "Rhythm" };
Object.getPrototypeOf(obj); // Object.prototype

// Prototype chain
// obj -> Object.prototype -> null

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
// arr -> Array.prototype -> Object.prototype -> null
// That's why arrays have .map, .filter, etc.

// Creating objects with prototypes
const personPrototype = {
  greet() {
    return `Hello, I'm ${this.name}`;
  },
};

const person = Object.create(personPrototype);
person.name = "Rhythm";
person.greet(); // "Hello, I'm Rhythm"

// Constructor functions (old way)
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function () {
  return `Hello, I'm ${this.name}`;
};

const rhythm = new Person("Rhythm", 21);
rhythm.greet(); // "Hello, I'm Rhythm"
rhythm instanceof Person; // true

// CLASSES - syntactic sugar over prototypes

class Person {
  // Constructor
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  // Instance method (on prototype)
  greet() {
    return `Hello, I'm ${this.name}`;
  }

  // Getter
  get birthYear() {
    return new Date().getFullYear() - this.age;
  }

  // Setter
  set birthYear(year) {
    this.age = new Date().getFullYear() - year;
  }

  // Static method (on class, not instances)
  static createAnonymous() {
    return new Person("Anonymous", 0);
  }

  // Private field (starts with #)
  #privateField = "secret";

  // Private method
  #privateMethod() {
    return this.#privateField;
  }

  // Access private from public method
  getSecret() {
    return this.#privateMethod();
  }
}

const person = new Person("Rhythm", 21);
person.greet(); // "Hello, I'm Rhythm"
person.birthYear; // 2005 (getter)
person.birthYear = 2000; // Sets age to 26 (setter)
Person.createAnonymous(); // Static method

// Inheritance
class Student extends Person {
  constructor(name, age, grade) {
    super(name, age); // Call parent constructor
    this.grade = grade;
  }

  // Override parent method
  greet() {
    return `${super.greet()}, I'm in grade ${this.grade}`;
  }

  study() {
    return `${this.name} is studying`;
  }
}

const student = new Student("Rhythm", 21, 12);
student.greet(); // "Hello, I'm Rhythm, I'm in grade 12"
student.study(); // "Rhythm is studying"
student instanceof Student; // true
student instanceof Person; // true

// Class expressions
const MyClass = class {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
  }
};
```

**Week 11: The `this` Keyword & Patterns**

```javascript
// 'this' depends on HOW a function is called, not WHERE it's defined

// 1. Global context
console.log(this); // window (browser) or global (Node)

// 2. Object method
const obj = {
  name: "Rhythm",
  greet() {
    console.log(this.name); // 'Rhythm'
  },
};
obj.greet();

// 3. Function call
function standalone() {
  console.log(this); // window (non-strict) or undefined (strict)
}
standalone();

// 4. Constructor (new keyword)
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name; // 'this' is the new object
}
const p = new Person("Rhythm");

// 5. Explicit binding (call, apply, bind)
function greet(greeting) {
  console.log(`${greeting}, ${this.name}`);
}

const user = { name: "Rhythm" };

greet.call(user, "Hello"); // "Hello, Rhythm"
greet.apply(user, ["Hi"]); // "Hi, Rhythm"

const boundGreet = greet.bind(user);
boundGreet("Hey"); // "Hey, Rhythm"

// 6. Arrow functions - NO own 'this', inherits from surrounding scope
const obj2 = {
  name: "Rhythm",
  greet: () => {
    console.log(this.name); // undefined! Arrow inherits outer 'this'
  },
  greetLater() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(this.name); // 'Rhythm'! Arrow inherits from greetLater
    }, 1000);
  },
};

// Common gotcha
const obj3 = {
  name: "Rhythm",
  greet() {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

const greetFn = obj3.greet;
greetFn(); // undefined! 'this' is lost when method is extracted

// Fix with bind
const boundFn = obj3.greet.bind(obj3);
boundFn(); // 'Rhythm'

// DESIGN PATTERNS

// Module Pattern (encapsulation)
const Calculator = (function () {
  // Private
  let result = 0;

  // Public API
  return {
    add(x) {
      result += x;
      return this;
    },
    subtract(x) {
      result -= x;
      return this;
    },
    getResult() {
      return result;
    },
    reset() {
      result = 0;
      return this;
    },
  };
})();

Calculator.add(5).add(3).subtract(2).getResult(); // 6

// Factory Pattern (create objects without 'new')
function createUser(name, role) {
  return {
    name,
    role,
    greet() {
      return `Hi, I'm ${this.name}`;
    },
  };
}

const user1 = createUser("Alice", "admin");
const user2 = createUser("Bob", "user");

// Observer Pattern (pub/sub)
class EventEmitter {
  constructor() {
    this.events = {};
  }

  on(event, callback) {
    if (!this.events[event]) {
      this.events[event] = [];
    }
    this.events[event].push(callback);
    return this;
  }

  off(event, callback) {
    if (this.events[event]) {
      this.events[event] = this.events[event].filter((cb) => cb !== callback);
    }
    return this;
  }

  emit(event, data) {
    if (this.events[event]) {
      this.events[event].forEach((callback) => callback(data));
    }
    return this;
  }
}

const emitter = new EventEmitter();
emitter.on("message", (data) => console.log("Received:", data));
emitter.emit("message", "Hello World");

// Singleton Pattern (single instance)
class Database {
  static instance = null;

  constructor() {
    if (Database.instance) {
      return Database.instance;
    }
    Database.instance = this;
    this.connection = "connected";
  }

  query(sql) {
    return `Executing: ${sql}`;
  }
}

const db1 = new Database();
const db2 = new Database();
console.log(db1 === db2); // true (same instance)
```

#### A2.2: TypeScript (Week 12-14)

> **Why this matters:** TypeScript is no longer optional. 90%+ of serious React jobs require it. It catches bugs before they happen. Learn it now, not later.

> **Time Investment:** ~3 hrs/day | **Total:** ~45 hours over 3 weeks

**Week 12: TypeScript Basics**

```typescript
// WHY TYPESCRIPT?
// 1. Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
// 2. Better IDE support (autocomplete, refactoring)
// 3. Self-documenting code
// 4. Required for most React jobs

// BASIC TYPES

// Primitives
let name: string = "Rhythm";
let age: number = 21;
let isStudent: boolean = true;
let nothing: null = null;
let notDefined: undefined = undefined;

// Type inference (TypeScript figures out the type)
let inferred = "Hello"; // TypeScript knows this is a string
// inferred = 123;  // Error! Can't assign number to string

// Arrays
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let strings: string[] = ["a", "b", "c"];
let mixed: (string | number)[] = [1, "two", 3]; // Union type

// Alternative syntax
let nums: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];

// Tuples (fixed-length arrays with specific types)
let tuple: [string, number] = ["hello", 42];
// tuple = [42, "hello"];  // Error! Wrong order

// Objects
let person: { name: string; age: number } = {
  name: "Rhythm",
  age: 21,
};

// Optional properties
let user: { name: string; email?: string } = {
  name: "Rhythm",
  // email is optional
};

// Any (escape hatch - avoid when possible)
let anything: any = "hello";
anything = 123; // No error, but defeats the purpose

// Unknown (safer than any)
let unknown: unknown = "hello";
// unknown.toUpperCase();  // Error! Must check type first
if (typeof unknown === "string") {
  unknown.toUpperCase(); // OK now
}

// FUNCTIONS

// Parameter and return types
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

// Arrow function
const multiply = (a: number, b: number): number => a * b;

// Optional parameters
function greet(name: string, greeting?: string): string {
  return `${greeting || "Hello"}, ${name}!`;
}

// Default parameters
function greetDefault(name: string, greeting: string = "Hello"): string {
  return `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
}

// Rest parameters
function sum(...numbers: number[]): number {
  return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}

// Void return (no return value)
function logMessage(message: string): void {
  console.log(message);
}

// Never return (throws or infinite loop)
function throwError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}

// Function types
type MathOperation = (a: number, b: number) => number;

const subtract: MathOperation = (a, b) => a - b;

// TYPE ALIASES

type ID = string | number;

type User = {
  id: ID;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age?: number; // Optional
};

const user1: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Rhythm",
  email: "r@r.com",
};

// Union types
type Status = "pending" | "approved" | "rejected"; // Literal types
let status: Status = "pending";
// status = "other";  // Error!

type StringOrNumber = string | number;

// Intersection types
type Employee = User & {
  employeeId: string;
  department: string;
};

const employee: Employee = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Rhythm",
  email: "r@r.com",
  employeeId: "EMP001",
  department: "Engineering",
};
```

**Week 13: Intermediate TypeScript**

```typescript
// INTERFACES (similar to type aliases, but for objects)

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// Extending interfaces
interface Admin extends User {
  role: "admin";
  permissions: string[];
}

// Implementing interfaces (with classes)
interface Printable {
  print(): void;
}

class Document implements Printable {
  print() {
    console.log("Printing...");
  }
}

// Interface vs Type Alias
// - Interfaces: better for objects, can be extended/merged
// - Type aliases: better for unions, primitives, functions

// Declaration merging (only interfaces)
interface User {

**Week 14: Advanced TypeScript**

```typescript
// UTILITY TYPES (built-in type transformations)

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
}

// Partial<T> - all properties optional
type PartialUser = Partial<User>;
// { id?: number; name?: string; email?: string; password?: string; }

// Required<T> - all properties required
type RequiredUser = Required<PartialUser>;

// Readonly<T> - all properties readonly
type ReadonlyUser = Readonly<User>;

// Pick<T, K> - select specific properties
type UserCredentials = Pick<User, "email" | "password">;
// { email: string; password: string; }

// Omit<T, K> - exclude specific properties
type PublicUser = Omit<User, "password">;
// { id: number; name: string; email: string; }

// Record<K, T> - create object type with key type and value type
type UserRoles = Record<string, "admin" | "user" | "guest">;
const roles: UserRoles = {
  rhythm: "admin",
  john: "user",
};

// Exclude<T, U> - remove types from union
type NotString = Exclude<string | number | boolean, string>;
// number | boolean

// Extract<T, U> - keep only matching types
type OnlyString = Extract<string | number | boolean, string>;
// string

// NonNullable<T> - remove null and undefined
type MaybeString = string | null | undefined;
type DefinitelyString = NonNullable<MaybeString>;
// string

// ReturnType<T> - get return type of function
function getUser() {
  return { id: 1, name: "Rhythm" };
}
type UserReturn = ReturnType<typeof getUser>;
// { id: number; name: string; }

// Parameters<T> - get parameter types as tuple
type GetUserParams = Parameters<typeof getUser>;
// []

function createUser(name: string, age: number) {
  return { name, age };
}
type CreateUserParams = Parameters<typeof createUser>;
// [string, number]

// MAPPED TYPES

type Nullable<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]: T[P] | null;
};

type NullableUser = Nullable<User>;
// All properties can be their type or null

// Conditional types
type IsString<T> = T extends string ? "yes" : "no";
type A = IsString<string>; // "yes"
type B = IsString<number>; // "no"

// Template literal types
type EventName = `on${Capitalize<string>}`;
// "onAnything", "onClick", etc.

type HttpMethod = "GET" | "POST" | "PUT" | "DELETE";
type ApiEndpoint = `/${string}`;
type ApiRoute = `${HttpMethod} ${ApiEndpoint}`;
// "GET /users", "POST /users", etc.

// DECLARATION FILES (.d.ts)
// Type definitions for JavaScript libraries

// Example: types for a JS library
declare module "my-library" {
  export function doSomething(value: string): number;
  export interface Config {
    debug: boolean;
    timeout: number;
  }
}

// TYPE ASSERTIONS (tell TypeScript you know better)

// 'as' syntax (preferred)
const input = document.getElementById("input") as HTMLInputElement;
input.value = "Hello";

// Angle bracket syntax (doesn't work in JSX)
const input2 = <HTMLInputElement>document.getElementById("input");

// Non-null assertion (careful!)
const element = document.getElementById("exists")!; // ! asserts not null

// Double assertion (escape hatch, avoid)
const value = "hello" as unknown as number; // Bad practice

// TYPE INFERENCE BEST PRACTICES

// Let TypeScript infer when obvious
const name = "Rhythm"; // string inferred
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]; // number[] inferred

// Annotate function parameters
function greet(name: string) {
  // Parameter annotated
  return `Hello, ${name}`; // Return type inferred
}

// Annotate when TypeScript can't infer
const parse = (json: string): User => {
  return JSON.parse(json); // JSON.parse returns 'any', so annotate return
};
```

**TypeScript with DOM:**

```typescript
// DOM element types
const button = document.querySelector("button"); // HTMLButtonElement | null
const input = document.querySelector("input"); // HTMLInputElement | null
const div = document.getElementById("myDiv"); // HTMLElement | null

// Type assertion when you know the element exists
const button2 = document.querySelector("button") as HTMLButtonElement;
const input2 = document.querySelector('input[type="text"]') as HTMLInputElement;

// Null check
const button3 = document.querySelector("button");
if (button3) {
  button3.addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Clicked!");
  });
}

// Event types
button?.addEventListener("click", (event: MouseEvent) => {
  console.log(event.clientX, event.clientY);
});

input?.addEventListener("input", (event: Event) => {
  const target = event.target as HTMLInputElement;
  console.log(target.value);
});

// Form handling
const form = document.querySelector("form");
form?.addEventListener("submit", (event: SubmitEvent) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const formData = new FormData(event.target as HTMLFormElement);
  const name = formData.get("name") as string;
});
```

### Month 4-5: React & Testing

#### A3.1: React Fundamentals (Week 15-17)

> **Why this matters:** React is the industry standard. Every other company uses it. But here's the thing — most React tutorials teach you the syntax without teaching you why things work. You need both.

> **Time Investment:** ~4 hrs/day | **Total:** ~60 hours over 3 weeks

**Week 15: Core Concepts**

**Day 1-2: Setup & JSX**

```tsx
// Create a new React project with TypeScript
// npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts

// JSX - JavaScript XML
// Looks like HTML, but it's JavaScript

// Basic component
function Welcome() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}

// JSX expressions (use curly braces for JavaScript)
const name = "Rhythm";
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;

// Expressions can be any valid JavaScript
const element2 = <p>2 + 2 = {2 + 2}</p>;
const element3 = <p>Today is {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</p>;

// JSX differences from HTML
// 1. className instead of class
<div className="container">Content</div>

// 2. htmlFor instead of for
<label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
<input id="email" type="email" />

// 3. camelCase for attributes
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>
<input onChange={handleChange} />
<div tabIndex={0}>Focusable</div>

// 4. style is an object
<div style={{ color: 'red', fontSize: '16px' }}>Styled</div>

// 5. Self-closing tags must have /
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="Photo" />
<input type="text" />
<br />

// 6. All elements must be wrapped in a single parent
// Use fragments to avoid extra div
function Component() {
    return (
        <>
            <h1>Title</h1>
            <p>Paragraph</p>
        </>
    );
}

// 7. Comments in JSX
function ComponentWithComments() {
    return (
        <div>
            {/* This is a comment */}
            <h1>Title</h1>
        </div>
    );
}
```

**Day 3-4: Components & Props**

```tsx
// Components are functions that return JSX
// They must start with a capital letter

// Function component (modern way)
function Greeting() {
    return <h1>Hello!</h1>;
}

// Arrow function component
const Greeting2 = () => {
    return <h1>Hello!</h1>;
};

// Using components
function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Greeting />
            <Greeting2 />
        </div>
    );
}

// PROPS - passing data to components

// Define props type
interface GreetingProps {
    name: string;
    age?: number;  // Optional
}

// Using props
function Greeting({ name, age }: GreetingProps) {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
            {age && <p>You are {age} years old</p>}
        </div>
    );
}

// Using the component
<Greeting name="Rhythm" age={21} />
<Greeting name="John" />  // age is optional

// Default props
interface ButtonProps {
    text: string;
    variant?: "primary" | "secondary";
}

function Button({ text, variant = "primary" }: ButtonProps) {
    return <button className={`btn btn-${variant}`}>{text}</button>;
}

// Children prop
interface CardProps {
    title: string;
    children: React.ReactNode;  // Any valid React content
}

function Card({ title, children }: CardProps) {
    return (
        <div className="card">
            <h2>{title}</h2>
            <div className="card-body">{children}</div>
        </div>
    );
}

// Using children
<Card title="My Card">
    <p>This is the card content</p>
    <button>Click me</button>
</Card>

// Props are READ-ONLY
// Never modify props directly!
function BadComponent({ name }: { name: string }) {
    // name = "Changed";  // ERROR! Never do this
    return <h1>{name}</h1>;
}

// Destructuring props
interface UserProps {
    user: {
        name: string;
        email: string;
        avatar: string;
    };
}

function UserProfile({ user }: UserProps) {
    const { name, email, avatar } = user;
    return (
        <div>
            <img src={avatar} alt={name} />
            <h2>{name}</h2>
            <p>{email}</p>
        </div>
    );
}

// Spread props
interface InputProps extends React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement> {
    label: string;
}

function Input({ label, ...inputProps }: InputProps) {
    return (
        <div>
            <label>{label}</label>
            <input {...inputProps} />
        </div>
    );
}

// All input attributes are passed through
<Input label="Email" type="email" placeholder="Enter email" required />
```

**Day 5: Conditional Rendering**

```tsx
interface MessageProps {
  isLoggedIn: boolean;
  username?: string;
  notifications: number;
  error?: string | null;
}

function Dashboard({
  isLoggedIn,
  username,
  notifications,
  error,
}: MessageProps) {
  // 1. Logical AND (&&) - show if truthy
  // Short-circuit: if left side is falsy, return it; otherwise return right side
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn && <p>Welcome back!</p>}
      {notifications > 0 && <span>You have {notifications} notifications</span>}
      {/* Be careful with 0! */}
      {notifications && <span>Notifications</span>}{" "}
      {/* Shows "0" if notifications is 0 */}
      {notifications > 0 && <span>Notifications</span>} {/* Correct! */}
    </div>
  );
}

// 2. Ternary operator - either/or
function Greeting({ isLoggedIn, username }: MessageProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome, {username}!</h1> : <h1>Please log in</h1>}
    </div>
  );
}

// 3. Early return
function UserGreeting({
  isLoggedIn,
  username,
}: {
  isLoggedIn: boolean;
  username: string;
}) {
  if (!isLoggedIn) {
    return <button>Log In</button>;
  }

  return <h1>Welcome, {username}!</h1>;
}

// 4. Variable assignment
function Notification({ type }: { type: "success" | "error" | "warning" }) {
  let icon;
  let color;

  switch (type) {
    case "success":
      icon = "✓";
      color = "green";
      break;
    case "error":
      icon = "✗";
      color = "red";
      break;
    case "warning":
      icon = "⚠";
      color = "orange";
      break;
  }

  return (
    <div style={{ color }}>
      <span>{icon}</span>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}

// 5. Null for no output
function MaybeComponent({ show }: { show: boolean }) {
  if (!show) {
    return null; // Renders nothing
  }

  return <div>Visible content</div>;
}
```

**Day 6-7: Lists & Events**

```tsx
// RENDERING LISTS

interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

function TodoList({ todos }: { todos: Todo[] }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        // Key is REQUIRED for list items
        // Must be unique and stable (not index if list changes)
        <li key={todo.id}>
          <span
            style={{
              textDecoration: todo.completed ? "line-through" : "none",
            }}
          >
            {todo.text}
          </span>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

// Why keys matter:
// - React uses keys to identify which items changed
// - Without keys, React re-renders all items
// - Don't use index as key if items can be reordered/deleted

// Extracting list item component
function TodoItem({ todo }: { todo: Todo }) {
  return (
    <li>
      <span>{todo.text}</span>
    </li>
  );
}

function TodoList2({ todos }: { todos: Todo[] }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        <TodoItem key={todo.id} todo={todo} />
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

// EVENTS

function EventExamples() {
  // Click event
  const handleClick = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
    console.log("Button clicked!", event.clientX);
  };

  // Input change event
  const handleChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    console.log("Input value:", event.target.value);
  };

  // Form submit event
  const handleSubmit = (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent page reload
    console.log("Form submitted!");
  };

  // Keyboard event
  const handleKeyDown = (event: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    if (event.key === "Enter") {
      console.log("Enter pressed!");
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
      <input onChange={handleChange} onKeyDown={handleKeyDown} />
    </form>
  );
}

// Passing arguments to event handlers
function ItemList({ items }: { items: string[] }) {
  const handleDelete = (id: number) => {
    console.log("Deleting item:", id);
  };

  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>
          {item}
          {/* Arrow function to pass argument */}
          <button onClick={() => handleDelete(index)}>Delete</button>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

// Passing event handlers as props
interface ButtonProps {
  onClick: (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

function CustomButton({ onClick, children }: ButtonProps) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>;
}

function Parent() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log("Clicked from parent!");
  };

  return <CustomButton onClick={handleClick}>Click me</CustomButton>;
}
```

**Week 16: React Hooks**

**Day 1-2: useState**

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

// Basic useState
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initial value: 0

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// useState with TypeScript
function TypedCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState<string>("");
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
}

// IMPORTANT: Updating state based on previous state
function Counter2() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // BAD: May not work correctly with multiple updates
  const incrementBad = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
    setCount(count + 1); // Still uses old count value!
  };

  // GOOD: Use callback form for dependent updates
  const incrementGood = () => {
    setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
    setCount((prev) => prev + 1); // Works correctly!
  };

  return <button onClick={incrementGood}>Increment by 2</button>;
}

// State with objects
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
}

function UserForm() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User>({
    name: "",
    email: "",
    age: 0,
  });

  // Updating object state - ALWAYS create new object
  const updateName = (name: string) => {
    // BAD: mutating state directly
    // user.name = name;  // Never do this!

    // GOOD: spread and override
    setUser((prev) => ({ ...prev, name }));
  };

  const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setUser((prev) => ({ ...prev, [name]: value }));
  };

  return (
    <form>
      <input name="name" value={user.name} onChange={handleChange} />
      <input name="email" value={user.email} onChange={handleChange} />
    </form>
  );
}

// State with arrays
function TodoApp() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState("");

  // Add item
  const addTodo = () => {
    if (input.trim()) {
      setTodos((prev) => [...prev, input]); // Spread + new item
      setInput("");
    }
  };

  // Remove item
  const removeTodo = (index: number) => {
    setTodos((prev) => prev.filter((_, i) => i !== index));
  };

  // Update item
  const updateTodo = (index: number, newText: string) => {
    setTodos((prev) => prev.map((todo, i) => (i === index ? newText : todo)));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        value={input}
        onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
        onKeyDown={(e) => e.key === "Enter" && addTodo()}
      />
      <button onClick={addTodo}>Add</button>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo, index) => (
          <li key={index}>
            {todo}
            <button onClick={() => removeTodo(index)}>Delete</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

// Lazy initial state (for expensive computations)
function ExpensiveComponent() {
  // This function runs only once, on initial render
  const [state, setState] = useState(() => {
    const initialState = someExpensiveComputation();
    return initialState;
  });
}
```

**Day 3-4: useEffect**

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

// useEffect runs AFTER render
// Used for side effects: data fetching, subscriptions, DOM manipulation

// Basic useEffect - runs after every render
function Logger({ count }: { count: number }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component rendered!");
    console.log("Count is:", count);
  }); // No dependency array = runs after every render

  return <div>{count}</div>;
}

// Empty dependency array - runs once after initial render
function OnMount() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component mounted!");

    // Cleanup function (runs on unmount)
    return () => {
      console.log("Component unmounted!");
    };
  }, []); // Empty array = only on mount/unmount
}

// With dependencies - runs when dependencies change
function DataFetcher({ userId }: { userId: number }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchUser = async () => {
      try {
        setLoading(true);
        setError(null);

        const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Failed to fetch");

        const data = await response.json();
        setUser(data);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : "Unknown error");
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchUser();
  }, [userId]); // Re-run when userId changes

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;
  if (!user) return <div>No user found</div>;

  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}

// Cleanup - VERY IMPORTANT
function EventListener() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      console.log("Window resized:", window.innerWidth);
    };

    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);

    // Cleanup: remove listener when component unmounts
    // or before effect runs again
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    };
  }, []);
}

// Timer example with cleanup
function Timer() {
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setSeconds((prev) => prev + 1);
    }, 1000);

    // Cleanup: clear interval
    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, []);

  return <div>Seconds: {seconds}</div>;
}

// Common mistakes and fixes

// 1. Missing dependency
function BadEffect({ userId }: { userId: number }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // ESLint will warn: userId is used but not in dependencies
    fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`)
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then(setUser);
  }, []); // BAD: userId should be in dependencies
}

// 2. Object/function dependencies
function ParentComponent() {
  // This object is recreated every render
  const config = { theme: "dark" };

  // This function is recreated every render
  const handleClick = () => console.log("clicked");

  return <ChildComponent config={config} onClick={handleClick} />;
}

// 3. Infinite loop
function InfiniteLoop() {
  const [data, setData] = useState<string[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This creates infinite loop!
    setData([...data, "new item"]); // State change triggers re-render
  }, [data]); // data is dependency, but we're changing data
}
```

**Day 5: useRef & useContext**

```tsx
import { useRef, useContext, createContext, useState } from "react";

// useRef - mutable value that persists across renders
// Does NOT trigger re-render when changed

// DOM reference
function FocusInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

  const focusInput = () => {
    inputRef.current?.focus(); // Access DOM element
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Mutable value (like instance variable)
function Timer2() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const intervalRef = useRef<number | null>(null);

  const start = () => {
    if (intervalRef.current !== null) return; // Already running

    intervalRef.current = window.setInterval(() => {
      setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
    }, 1000);
  };

  const stop = () => {
    if (intervalRef.current !== null) {
      clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
      intervalRef.current = null;
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={start}>Start</button>
      <button onClick={stop}>Stop</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Previous value
function PreviousValue({ value }: { value: number }) {
  const prevRef = useRef<number>();

  useEffect(() => {
    prevRef.current = value;
  }, [value]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current: {value}</p>
      <p>Previous: {prevRef.current}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// CONTEXT - share data without prop drilling

// 1. Create context
interface ThemeContextType {
  theme: "light" | "dark";
  toggleTheme: () => void;
}

const ThemeContext = createContext<ThemeContextType | null>(null);

// 2. Create provider component
function ThemeProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<"light" | "dark">("light");

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme((prev) => (prev === "light" ? "dark" : "light"));
  };

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

// 3. Custom hook for consuming context
function useTheme() {
  const context = useContext(ThemeContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error("useTheme must be used within ThemeProvider");
  }
  return context;
}

// 4. Use in components
function ThemedButton() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={toggleTheme}
      style={{
        background: theme === "dark" ? "#333" : "#fff",
        color: theme === "dark" ? "#fff" : "#333",
      }}
    >
      Toggle Theme (Current: {theme})
    </button>
  );
}

// 5. Wrap app with provider
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <div>
        <h1>My App</h1>
        <ThemedButton />
      </div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

**Day 6-7: useReducer & Custom Hooks**

```tsx
import { useReducer, useState, useEffect } from "react";

// useReducer - alternative to useState for complex state logic

// Define state and action types
interface State {
  count: number;
  error: string | null;
}

type Action =
  | { type: "increment" }
  | { type: "decrement" }
  | { type: "reset" }
  | { type: "set"; payload: number };

// Reducer function
function reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1, error: null };
    case "decrement":
      if (state.count <= 0) {
        return { ...state, error: "Cannot go below 0" };
      }
      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1, error: null };
    case "reset":
      return { count: 0, error: null };
    case "set":
      return { ...state, count: action.payload, error: null };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function Counter3() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0, error: null });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      {state.error && <p style={{ color: "red" }}>{state.error}</p>}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "reset" })}>Reset</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "set", payload: 10 })}>
        Set to 10
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

// CUSTOM HOOKS - extract and reuse logic

// useLocalStorage hook
function useLocalStorage<T>(key: string, initialValue: T) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<T>(() => {
    const stored = localStorage.getItem(key);
    return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : initialValue;
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  }, [key, value]);

  return [value, setValue] as const;
}

// Usage
function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useLocalStorage("name", "");
  return <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />;
}

// useDebounce hook
function useDebounce<T>(value: T, delay: number): T {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value);
    }, delay);

    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, [value, delay]);

  return debouncedValue;
}

// Usage
function Search() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
  const debouncedQuery = useDebounce(query, 300);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (debouncedQuery) {
      // Only search after user stops typing
      searchAPI(debouncedQuery);
    }
  }, [debouncedQuery]);
}

// useFetch hook
interface UseFetchResult<T> {
  data: T | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

function useFetch<T>(url: string): UseFetchResult<T> {
  const [data, setData] = useState<T | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const controller = new AbortController();

    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        setLoading(true);
        const response = await fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal });
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
        const json = await response.json();
        setData(json);
        setError(null);
      } catch (err) {
        if (err instanceof Error && err.name !== "AbortError") {
          setError(err.message);
        }
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchData();

    return () => controller.abort();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading, error };
}

// Usage
function UserProfile({ userId }: { userId: number }) {
  const { data: user, loading, error } = useFetch<User>(`/api/users/${userId}`);

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;
  if (!user) return null;

  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}

// useOnClickOutside hook
function useOnClickOutside(
  ref: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>,
  handler: () => void,
) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const listener = (event: MouseEvent | TouchEvent) => {
      if (!ref.current || ref.current.contains(event.target as Node)) {
        return;
      }
      handler();
    };

    document.addEventListener("mousedown", listener);
    document.addEventListener("touchstart", listener);

    return () => {
      document.removeEventListener("mousedown", listener);
      document.removeEventListener("touchstart", listener);
    };
  }, [ref, handler]);
}

// Usage: close modal when clicking outside
function Modal({ onClose }: { onClose: () => void }) {
  const modalRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  useOnClickOutside(modalRef, onClose);

  return (
    <div className="modal-overlay">
      <div ref={modalRef} className="modal">
        Modal content
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### A3.1: React Fundamentals (Continued)

**Week 17: React Router & State Management**

**Day 1-3: React Router**

```tsx
// Install: npm install react-router-dom

import {
  BrowserRouter,
  Routes,
  Route,
  Link,
  NavLink,
  useNavigate,
  useParams,
  useSearchParams,
  useLocation,
  Navigate,
  Outlet,
} from "react-router-dom";

// Basic setup
function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        <Link to="/users">Users</Link>
      </nav>

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        <Route path="/users" element={<Users />} />
        <Route path="/users/:id" element={<UserProfile />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

// NavLink - adds active class automatically
function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <NavLink to="/" className={({ isActive }) => (isActive ? "active" : "")}>
        Home
      </NavLink>
      <NavLink to="/about">About</NavLink>
    </nav>
  );
}

// useParams - access URL parameters
function UserProfile() {
  const { id } = useParams<{ id: string }>();
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`/api/users/${id}`)
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then(setUser);
  }, [id]);

  if (!user) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}

// useNavigate - programmatic navigation
function LoginForm() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const success = await login();
    if (success) {
      navigate("/dashboard"); // Navigate on success
      // navigate('/dashboard', { replace: true });  // Replace history
      // navigate(-1);  // Go back
    }
  };

  return <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>...</form>;
}

// useSearchParams - query string parameters
function SearchPage() {
  const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const query = searchParams.get("q") || "";
  const page = searchParams.get("page") || "1";

  const updateSearch = (newQuery: string) => {
    setSearchParams({ q: newQuery, page: "1" });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={query} onChange={(e) => updateSearch(e.target.value)} />
      <p>
        Searching for: {query}, Page: {page}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}

// useLocation - access location object
function CurrentPath() {
  const location = useLocation();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Path: {location.pathname}</p>
      <p>Search: {location.search}</p>
      <p>Hash: {location.hash}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// Nested routes with Outlet
function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      <nav>
        <Link to="overview">Overview</Link>
        <Link to="settings">Settings</Link>
      </nav>
      <Outlet /> {/* Child routes render here */}
    </div>
  );
}

function AppWithNested() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />}>
          <Route index element={<DashboardOverview />} />
          <Route path="overview" element={<DashboardOverview />} />
          <Route path="settings" element={<DashboardSettings />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

// Protected routes
interface ProtectedRouteProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

function ProtectedRoute({ children }: ProtectedRouteProps) {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth(); // Your auth hook
  const location = useLocation();

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (!user) {
    // Redirect to login, but save the attempted URL
    return <Navigate to="/login" state={{ from: location }} replace />;
  }

  return <>{children}</>;
}

// Usage
function AppWithProtection() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
        <Route
          path="/dashboard"

}

// After login, redirect back to attempted page
function Login() {

  const from = (location.state as any)?.from?.pathname || "/dashboard";

  const handleLogin = async () => {
    await login();
    navigate(from, { replace: true });
  };
}
```

**Day 4-5: State Management with Zustand**

```tsx
// Zustand is simpler than Redux, perfect for most apps
// Install: npm install zustand

import { create } from "zustand";
import { persist } from "zustand/middleware";

// Basic store
interface CounterStore {
  count: number;
  increment: () => void;
  decrement: () => void;
  reset: () => void;
}

const useCounterStore = create<CounterStore>((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  decrement: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - 1 })),
  reset: () => set({ count: 0 }),
}));

// Using the store
function Counter() {
  const { count, increment, decrement, reset } = useCounterStore();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Select specific state (prevents unnecessary re-renders)
function CountDisplay() {
  const count = useCounterStore((state) => state.count);
  return <p>Count: {count}</p>;
}

// More complex store example
interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

interface TodoStore {
  todos: Todo[];
  filter: "all" | "active" | "completed";
  addTodo: (text: string) => void;
  toggleTodo: (id: number) => void;
  deleteTodo: (id: number) => void;
  setFilter: (filter: "all" | "active" | "completed") => void;
  filteredTodos: () => Todo[];
}

const useTodoStore = create<TodoStore>((set, get) => ({
  todos: [],
  filter: "all",

  addTodo: (text) =>
    set((state) => ({
      todos: [...state.todos, { id: Date.now(), text, completed: false }],
    })),

  toggleTodo: (id) =>
    set((state) => ({
      todos: state.todos.map((todo) =>
        todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo,
      ),
    })),

  deleteTodo: (id) =>
    set((state) => ({
      todos: state.todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id),
    })),

  setFilter: (filter) => set({ filter }),

  // Computed value using get()
  filteredTodos: () => {
    const { todos, filter } = get();
    switch (filter) {
      case "active":
        return todos.filter((t) => !t.completed);
      case "completed":
        return todos.filter((t) => t.completed);
      default:
        return todos;
    }
  },
}));

// Persist to localStorage
const usePersistedStore = create(
  persist<CounterStore>(
    (set) => ({
      count: 0,
      increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
      decrement: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - 1 })),
      reset: () => set({ count: 0 }),
    }),
    {
      name: "counter-storage", // localStorage key
    },
  ),
);

// Async actions
interface UserStore {
  user: User | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  fetchUser: (id: number) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
}

const useUserStore = create<UserStore>((set) => ({
  user: null,
  loading: false,
  error: null,

  fetchUser: async (id) => {
    set({ loading: true, error: null });
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Failed to fetch");
      const user = await response.json();
      set({ user, loading: false });
    } catch (error) {
      set({
        error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unknown error",
        loading: false,
      });
    }
  },

  logout: () => set({ user: null }),
}));
```

**Day 6-7: Performance Optimization**

```tsx
import { memo, useMemo, useCallback, lazy, Suspense } from "react";

// React.memo - prevent re-renders if props haven't changed
interface ItemProps {
  item: { id: number; name: string };
  onDelete: (id: number) => void;
}

const Item = memo(function Item({ item, onDelete }: ItemProps) {
  console.log(`Rendering item ${item.id}`);
  return (
    <div>
      {item.name}
      <button onClick={() => onDelete(item.id)}>Delete</button>
    </div>
  );
});

// Custom comparison function
const ItemWithCustomMemo = memo(
  function Item({ item, onDelete }: ItemProps) {
    return <div>{item.name}</div>;
  },
  (prevProps, nextProps) => {
    // Return true if props are equal (skip re-render)
    return (
      prevProps.item.id === nextProps.item.id &&
      prevProps.item.name === nextProps.item.name
    );
  },
);

// useMemo - memoize expensive calculations
function ExpensiveList({ items, filter }: { items: Item[]; filter: string }) {
  // Only recalculate when items or filter changes
  const filteredItems = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Filtering items...");
    return items.filter((item) =>
      item.name.toLowerCase().includes(filter.toLowerCase()),
    );
  }, [items, filter]);

  // Sort is expensive, only do when filtered items change
  const sortedItems = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Sorting items...");
    return [...filteredItems].sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name));
  }, [filteredItems]);

  return (
    <ul>
      {sortedItems.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

// useCallback - memoize functions
function ParentComponent() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([]);
  const [filter, setFilter] = useState("");

  // Without useCallback, this is recreated every render
  // Child components with memo would still re-render
  const handleDelete = useCallback((id: number) => {
    setItems((prev) => prev.filter((item) => item.id !== id));
  }, []); // Empty deps = never changes

  const handleAdd = useCallback((name: string) => {
    setItems((prev) => [...prev, { id: Date.now(), name }]);
  }, []);

  return (

      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

// When to use useMemo/useCallback:
// 1. Expensive calculations
// 2. Referential equality for memo'd children
// 3. Dependencies for useEffect

// When NOT to use:
// 1. Simple calculations
// 2. Primitive values (they're already equal by value)
// 3. Everything "just in case" (adds overhead)

// Code splitting with lazy loading
const HeavyComponent = lazy(() => import("./HeavyComponent"));

function App() {
  const [showHeavy, setShowHeavy] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>

        </Routes>
      </Suspense>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

// Virtualization for long lists (react-window)
// npm install react-window
import { FixedSizeList } from "react-window";

#### A3.2: Testing (Week 18-19)

> **Why this matters:** Untestable code is unemployable code. Companies care about tests. Plus, writing tests forces you to write better code. It's not optional.

> **Time Investment:** ~3 hrs/day | **Total:** ~30 hours over 2 weeks

**Week 18: Unit & Integration Testing**

**Day 1-2: Testing Fundamentals**

```typescript
// Testing Philosophy:
// 1. Test behavior, not implementation
// 2. Write tests that give confidence
// 3. If it can break in production, test it

// The Testing Trophy (Kent C. Dodds):
// - Static Analysis (TypeScript, ESLint) - catches typos
// - Unit Tests - pure functions, utilities
// - Integration Tests - components working together (MOST tests here)
// - E2E Tests - critical user journeys only

// Test structure: Arrange, Act, Assert
test("adds two numbers", () => {
  // Arrange
  const a = 2;
  const b = 3;

  // Act
  const result = add(a, b);

  // Assert
  expect(result).toBe(5);
});

// Describe blocks for organization
describe("Calculator", () => {
  describe("add", () => {
    test("adds positive numbers", () => {
      expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
    });

    test("adds negative numbers", () => {
      expect(add(-2, -3)).toBe(-5);
    });

    test("adds zero", () => {
      expect(add(5, 0)).toBe(5);
    });
  });

  describe("divide", () => {
    test("divides numbers", () => {
      expect(divide(10, 2)).toBe(5);
    });

    test("throws on division by zero", () => {
      expect(() => divide(10, 0)).toThrow("Cannot divide by zero");
    });
  });
});
```

**Day 3-4: Jest Fundamentals**

```typescript
// Jest is the most popular testing framework
// Setup: npm install -D jest @types/jest ts-jest

// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  preset: "ts-jest",
  testEnvironment: "node",
  testMatch: ["**/*.test.ts", "**/*.test.tsx"],
  collectCoverageFrom: ["src/**/*.{ts,tsx}", "!src/**/*.d.ts"],
};

// MATCHERS

// Equality
expect(value).toBe(5); // Strict equality (===)
expect(object).toEqual({ a: 1 }); // Deep equality
expect(value).toBeNull();
expect(value).toBeUndefined();
expect(value).toBeDefined();
expect(value).toBeTruthy();
expect(value).toBeFalsy();

// Numbers
expect(value).toBeGreaterThan(3);
expect(value).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(3);
expect(value).toBeLessThan(5);
expect(value).toBeCloseTo(0.3, 5); // For floating point

// Strings
expect(string).toMatch(/regex/);
expect(string).toContain("substring");

// Arrays
expect(array).toContain(item);
expect(array).toContainEqual({ id: 1 }); // Deep equality
expect(array).toHaveLength(3);

// Objects
expect(object).toHaveProperty("name");
expect(object).toHaveProperty("user.name", "Rhythm");
expect(object).toMatchObject({ name: "Rhythm" }); // Partial match

// Exceptions
expect(() => badFunction()).toThrow();
expect(() => badFunction()).toThrow("Error message");
expect(() => badFunction()).toThrow(CustomError);

// Negation
expect(value).not.toBe(5);
expect(array).not.toContain(item);

// MOCKING

// Mock functions
const mockFn = jest.fn();
mockFn("arg1", "arg2");

expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalled();
expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalledWith("arg1", "arg2");

// Mock return values
const mockFn2 = jest.fn().mockReturnValue(10).mockReturnValueOnce(5); // First call returns 5

mockFn2(); // 5
mockFn2(); // 10
mockFn2(); // 10

// Mock implementation
const mockFn3 = jest.fn((x: number) => x * 2);

// Mock modules
jest.mock("./api", () => ({
  fetchUser: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: 1, name: "Test" }),
}));

// Spies (mock existing methods)
const consoleSpy = jest.spyOn(console, "log").mockImplementation();
// ... test ...
expect(consoleSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith("expected message");
consoleSpy.mockRestore();

// ASYNC TESTING

// Promises
test("fetches user", async () => {
  const user = await fetchUser(1);
  expect(user.name).toBe("Rhythm");
});

// Resolved/rejected values
test("resolves to user", async () => {
  await expect(fetchUser(1)).resolves.toEqual({ id: 1, name: "Rhythm" });
});

test("rejects with error", async () => {
  await expect(fetchUser(-1)).rejects.toThrow("User not found");
});

// SETUP AND TEARDOWN

describe("Database tests", () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    // Run once before all tests
    await connectDatabase();
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    // Run once after all tests
    await disconnectDatabase();
  });

  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Run before each test
    await clearDatabase();
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Run after each test
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  test("creates user", async () => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

**Day 5-7: React Testing Library**

```tsx
// React Testing Library philosophy:
// "The more your tests resemble the way your software is used,
// the more confidence they can give you."

// Setup: npm install -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom

import { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";
import "@testing-library/jest-dom";

// Basic rendering
test("renders welcome message", () => {
  render(<Welcome name="Rhythm" />);

  // Find element by text
  expect(screen.getByText("Hello, Rhythm!")).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// QUERIES (in order of preference)
// 1. getByRole - most accessible
// 2. getByLabelText - for form fields
// 3. getByPlaceholderText - if no label
// 4. getByText - for non-interactive elements
// 5. getByTestId - last resort

test("queries example", () => {
  render(
    <form>
      <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
      <input id="email" type="email" placeholder="Enter email" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>,
  );

  // By role (preferred)
  screen.getByRole("button", { name: /submit/i });
  screen.getByRole("textbox", { name: /email/i });

  // By label text
  screen.getByLabelText(/email/i);

  // By placeholder
  screen.getByPlaceholderText(/enter email/i);

  // By text
  screen.getByText(/submit/i);
});

// Query variants:
// getBy - throws if not found or multiple
// queryBy - returns null if not found (good for asserting absence)
// findBy - returns promise (for async)
// getAllBy, queryAllBy, findAllBy - for multiple elements

test("element not present", () => {
  render(<ComponentWithoutError />);

  // queryBy returns null instead of throwing
  expect(screen.queryByText("Error")).not.toBeInTheDocument();
});

test("element appears async", async () => {
  render(<AsyncComponent />);

  // findBy waits for element
  const element = await screen.findByText("Loaded");
  expect(element).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// USER EVENTS (prefer over fireEvent)
test("form submission", async () => {
  const user = userEvent.setup();
  const handleSubmit = jest.fn();

  render(<LoginForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />);

  // Type in inputs
  await user.type(screen.getByLabelText(/email/i), "test@example.com");

  // Keyboard
  await user.keyboard("{Enter}");

// TESTING ASYNC BEHAVIOR
test("loads data", async () => {

// TESTING WITH CONTEXT
const renderWithProviders = (ui: React.ReactElement) => {

// TESTING CUSTOM HOOKS
import { renderHook, act } from "@testing-library/react";

  expect(result.current.count).toBe(0);

  act(() => {

});

// SNAPSHOT TESTING (use sparingly)
test("matches snapshot", () => {
  const { container } = render(<Card title="Test" />);
  expect(container).toMatchSnapshot();
});

// Complete component test example
describe("TodoList", () => {
  const mockTodos = [

### Month 5-6: Styling & Build Tools

#### A4.1: Tailwind CSS (Week 20)

> **Why this matters:** Tailwind is the industry standard for rapid development. It's utility-first, which means you write less CSS and ship faster.

> **Time Investment:** ~3 hrs/day | **Total:** ~15 hours over 1 week

```tsx
// Setup with Vite:
// npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
// npx tailwindcss init -p

### Month 6-7: Backend Development

#### A5.1: Node.js Fundamentals (Week 22-23)

> **Why this matters:** You're about to become a full-stack developer. Node.js is JavaScript on the server. If you understood JavaScript well, this will feel like coming home.

> **Time Investment:** ~3-4 hrs/day | **Total:** ~40 hours over 2 weeks

**Week 22: Core Node.js**

```javascript
// What is Node.js?
// - JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine
// - Non-blocking, event-driven I/O
// - NOT a framework, NOT a language

// When to use Node.js:
// - API servers
// - Real-time applications (chat, gaming)
// - Microservices
// - Build tools (Vite, Webpack are Node.js apps)

// When NOT to use:
// - CPU-intensive tasks (use Go, Rust, or worker threads)

// Running Node.js
// node app.js
// node --watch app.js  // Auto-restart on changes

// MODULES

// ES Modules (modern - use this)
// package.json: "type": "module"

// Exporting
// math.js
export const PI = 3.14159;
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
export default function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

// Importing
import multiply, { PI, add } from "./math.js";

// CommonJS (older, still common)
// Exporting
module.exports = { add, subtract };
// or
exports.add = add;

// Importing
const { add, subtract } = require("./math.js");

// BUILT-IN MODULES

// fs - File System
import { readFile, writeFile, mkdir, readdir, unlink } from "fs/promises";

// Read file
const content = await readFile("./data.txt", "utf-8");
console.log(content);

// Write file
await writeFile("./output.txt", "Hello World");

// Read JSON
const data = JSON.parse(await readFile("./data.json", "utf-8"));

// Write JSON
await writeFile("./data.json", JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));

// Create directory
await mkdir("./new-folder", { recursive: true });

// List directory
const files = await readdir("./");
console.log(files);

// Delete file
await unlink("./temp.txt");

// Check if exists
import { access } from "fs/promises";
try {
  await access("./file.txt");
  console.log("File exists");
} catch {
  console.log("File does not exist");
}

// path - Work with file paths
import path from "path";

path.join("folder", "subfolder", "file.txt"); // 'folder/subfolder/file.txt'
path.resolve("./relative/path"); // Absolute path
path.dirname("/path/to/file.txt"); // '/path/to'
path.basename("/path/to/file.txt"); // 'file.txt'
path.extname("/path/to/file.txt"); // '.txt'

// ALWAYS use path.join for cross-platform compatibility
const filePath = path.join(__dirname, "data", "file.txt");

// process - Environment and process info
console.log(process.cwd()); // Current working directory
console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV); // Environment variable
console.log(process.argv); // Command line arguments
process.exit(0); // Exit with code

// http - HTTP server (low-level)
import http from "http";

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
  res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello World" }));
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running at http://localhost:3000");
});

// events - Event emitter
import { EventEmitter } from "events";

const emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.on("message", (data) => {
  console.log("Received:", data);
});

emitter.emit("message", "Hello World");
```

**Week 23: Express.js**

```typescript
// Express is the most popular Node.js web framework
// npm install express
// npm install -D @types/express

import express, { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";

const app = express();

// MIDDLEWARE - functions that process requests

// Built-in middleware
app.use(express.json()); // Parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // Parse form data
app.use(express.static("public")); // Serve static files

// Custom middleware
const logger = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  console.log(`${new Date().toISOString()} ${req.method} ${req.path}`);
  next(); // MUST call next() or request hangs
};

app.use(logger);

// Middleware for specific paths
app.use("/api", apiMiddleware);

// ROUTES

// GET - retrieve data
app.get("/", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send("Hello World");
});

app.get("/api/users", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const users = await getUsers();
  res.json(users);
});

// Route parameters
app.get("/api/users/:id", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const user = await getUserById(id);

  if (!user) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: "User not found" });
  }

  res.json(user);
});

// Query parameters: /api/users?page=1&limit=10
app.get("/api/users", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { page = "1", limit = "10" } = req.query;
  // ...
});

// POST - create data
app.post("/api/users", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { name, email } = req.body;

  // Validation
  if (!name || !email) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Name and email required" });
  }

  const user = await createUser({ name, email });
  res.status(201).json(user);
});

// PUT - replace entire resource
app.put("/api/users/:id", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const { name, email } = req.body;

  const user = await updateUser(id, { name, email });
  res.json(user);
});

// PATCH - partial update
app.patch("/api/users/:id", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const updates = req.body;

  const user = await partialUpdateUser(id, updates);
  res.json(user);
});

// DELETE
app.delete("/api/users/:id", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  await deleteUser(id);
  res.status(204).send(); // No content
});

// ROUTERS - organize routes

// routes/users.ts
import { Router } from "express";

const router = Router();

router.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  // GET /api/users
});

router.get("/:id", async (req, res) => {
  // GET /api/users/:id
});

router.post("/", async (req, res) => {
  // POST /api/users
});

export default router;

// app.ts
import userRouter from "./routes/users";
app.use("/api/users", userRouter);

// ERROR HANDLING

// Async error wrapper
const asyncHandler =
  (fn: Function) => (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    Promise.resolve(fn(req, res, next)).catch(next);
  };

app.get(
  "/api/data",
  asyncHandler(async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    const data = await fetchData(); // If this throws, error is caught
    res.json(data);
  }),
);

// Error handling middleware (must be last, must have 4 parameters)
app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  console.error(err.stack);

  if (err.name === "ValidationError") {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: err.message });
  }

  res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal Server Error" });
});

// Custom error class
class AppError extends Error {
  constructor(
    public statusCode: number,
    message: string,
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "AppError";
  }
}

// 404 handler (before error handler)
app.use((req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.status(404).json({ error: "Not Found" });
});

// Start server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

#### A5.2: REST API Design & Validation (Week 24)

```typescript
// REST PRINCIPLES

// 1. Resources are nouns, not verbs
// Good: GET /users, POST /users, GET /users/123
// Bad: GET /getUsers, POST /createUser

// 2. HTTP methods have meaning
// GET    = Read (safe, idempotent)
// POST   = Create
// PUT    = Replace entirely (idempotent)
// PATCH  = Partial update
// DELETE = Remove (idempotent)

// 3. Use proper status codes

// STATUS CODES (memorize these)

// 2xx Success
// 200 OK - General success
// 201 Created - Resource created (POST)
// 204 No Content - Success, no body (DELETE)

// 4xx Client Error
// 400 Bad Request - Invalid syntax
// 401 Unauthorized - Not authenticated
// 403 Forbidden - Authenticated but not allowed
// 404 Not Found - Resource doesn't exist
// 409 Conflict - Duplicate resource
// 422 Unprocessable Entity - Validation failed

// 5xx Server Error
// 500 Internal Server Error - Something broke

// VALIDATION WITH ZOD
// npm install zod

import { z } from "zod";

// Define schemas
const createUserSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email format"),
  password: z.string().min(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters"),
  name: z.string().min(2, "Name must be at least 2 characters"),
  age: z.number().int().min(0).max(150).optional(),
});

const updateUserSchema = createUserSchema.partial(); // All fields optional

// Type inference from schema
type CreateUserInput = z.infer<typeof createUserSchema>;

// Validation middleware
const validate = (schema: z.ZodSchema) => {
  return async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    try {
      req.body = await schema.parseAsync(req.body);
      next();
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof z.ZodError) {
        return res.status(422).json({
          error: "Validation failed",
          details: error.errors.map((e) => ({
            field: e.path.join("."),
            message: e.message,
          })),
        });
      }
      next(error);
    }
  };
};

// Usage
app.post("/api/users", validate(createUserSchema), async (req, res) => {
  // req.body is validated and typed
  const user = await createUser(req.body);
  res.status(201).json(user);
});

// Common Zod patterns
const productSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1).max(100),
  price: z.number().positive(),
  category: z.enum(["electronics", "clothing", "food"]),
  tags: z.array(z.string()).optional().default([]),
  metadata: z.record(z.string()).optional(), // Object with string values
  inStock: z.boolean().default(true),
});

// Query parameter validation
const paginationSchema = z.object({
  page: z.coerce.number().int().min(1).default(1),
  limit: z.coerce.number().int().min(1).max(100).default(20),
  sort: z.enum(["asc", "desc"]).optional(),
});

// API RESPONSE STRUCTURE

interface ApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
  meta?: {
    page: number;
    limit: number;
    total: number;
    totalPages: number;
  };
}

// Helper functions
const sendSuccess = <T>(res: Response, data: T, status = 200) => {
  res.status(status).json({ success: true, data });
};

const sendError = (res: Response, message: string, status = 400) => {
  res.status(status).json({ success: false, error: message });
};

const sendPaginated = <T>(
  res: Response,
  data: T[],
  page: number,
  limit: number,
  total: number,
) => {
  res.json({
    success: true,
    data,
    meta: {
      page,
      limit,
      total,
      totalPages: Math.ceil(total / limit),
    },
  });
};
```

#### A5.3: Authentication (Week 25)

```typescript
// npm install bcrypt jsonwebtoken
// npm install -D @types/bcrypt @types/jsonwebtoken

import bcrypt from "bcrypt";
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";

// NEVER store plain passwords
const SALT_ROUNDS = 10;
const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET || "your-secret-key";
const JWT_EXPIRES_IN = "7d";

// Password hashing
async function hashPassword(password: string): Promise<string> {
  return bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS);
}

async function comparePassword(
  password: string,
  hash: string,
): Promise<boolean> {
  return bcrypt.compare(password, hash);
}

// JWT functions
interface TokenPayload {
  userId: string;
  email: string;
}

function generateToken(payload: TokenPayload): string {
  return jwt.sign(payload, JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: JWT_EXPIRES_IN });
}

function verifyToken(token: string): TokenPayload {
  return jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET) as TokenPayload;
}

// Registration endpoint
app.post("/api/auth/register", validate(registerSchema), async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password, name } = req.body;

  // Check if user exists
  const existingUser = await db.user.findUnique({ where: { email } });
  if (existingUser) {
    return res.status(409).json({ error: "Email already registered" });
  }

  // Hash password
  const hashedPassword = await hashPassword(password);

    token,
  });
});

// Login endpoint
app.post("/api/auth/login", validate(loginSchema), async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;

  // Find user
  const user = await db.user.findUnique({ where: { email } });
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: "Invalid credentials" });

### Month 8-9: Full-Stack Integration

#### A6.1: Next.js (Week 29-31)

> **Why this matters:** Next.js is the industry standard for React applications. It combines frontend and backend in one framework. Most companies use it.

> **Time Investment:** ~4 hrs/day | **Total:** ~60 hours over 3 weeks

```tsx
// Create Next.js app
// npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --app

## DSA Practice Track

> **Goal:** 150-300 problems, interview-ready
> **Daily Time:** 1-2 hours (starting Week 1, not Month 3)
> **Why This Matters:** DSA is what gets you past the interview gate. In India, 90% of tech interviews start with DSA.

This is not optional. DSA is what separates "applied to 500 jobs, got 0 interviews" from "applied to 50 jobs, got 10 interviews."

---

### Why Start DSA from Week 1?

Most roadmaps tell you to start DSA after learning programming basics. That's wrong for job seekers.

**Reality:**

- Indian tech interviews are DSA-heavy
- Online assessments (OA) gate most applications
- You need 3-6 months of consistent practice
- Starting late = not ready when opportunities come

**The Strategy:**

- Week 1-4: 15-30 min/day, Easy problems only
- Month 2-3: 1 hour/day, Easy + some Medium
- Month 4+: 1.5-2 hours/day, Medium focus
- Month 6+: Mock interviews + Hard problems

---

### Phase 1: Foundations (Month 1-2)

> **Time Investment:** 30-60 min/day | **Goal:** 40-50 Easy problems

Start with patterns that appear most frequently. Master these before moving on.

**Week 1-2: Arrays & Strings**

```javascript
// Pattern: Iteration & Basic Operations

// Two Sum (Classic!)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Contains Duplicate
function containsDuplicate(nums) {
  const set = new Set();
  for (const num of nums) {
    if (set.has(num)) return true;
    set.add(num);
  }
  return false;
}

// Valid Anagram
function isAnagram(s, t) {
  if (s.length !== t.length) return false;
  const count = {};
  for (const char of s) {
    count[char] = (count[char] || 0) + 1;
  }
  for (const char of t) {
    if (!count[char]) return false;
    count[char]--;
  }
  return true;
}
```

**Problems to Solve (Week 1-2):**
| # | Problem | Difficulty | Pattern |
|---|---------|------------|---------|
| 1 | Two Sum | Easy | Hash Map |
| 2 | Contains Duplicate | Easy | Hash Set |
| 3 | Valid Anagram | Easy | Hash Map |
| 4 | Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock | Easy | Iteration |
| 5 | Valid Palindrome | Easy | Two Pointers |
| 6 | Maximum Subarray | Easy | Kadane's Algorithm |
| 7 | Merge Sorted Array | Easy | Two Pointers |
| 8 | Move Zeroes | Easy | Two Pointers |
| 9 | Plus One | Easy | Array |
| 10 | Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array | Easy | Two Pointers |

**Week 3-4: Two Pointers & Sliding Window**

```javascript
// Two Pointers Pattern
// Used when: sorted arrays, finding pairs, palindromes

// Valid Palindrome
function isPalindrome(s) {
  s = s.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, "");
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;

  while (left < right) {
    if (s[left] !== s[right]) return false;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;

**Week 21-22: Heaps & Priority Queues**

```javascript
// JavaScript doesn't have built-in heap, use array with helper functions
// Or use a library like 'heap-js'

// For interviews, know:
// 1. Heap operations: insert O(log n), extractMin/Max O(log n), peek O(1)
// 2. Building heap from array: O(n)
// 3. When to use: k largest/smallest, merge k sorted, median stream

// Kth Largest Element
function findKthLargest(nums, k) {
  // Using QuickSelect (optimal)
  function quickSelect(left, right, k) {
    const pivot = nums[right];
    let p = left;

function topKFrequent(nums, k) {
  const count = new Map();
  for (const num of nums) {
    count.set(num, (count.get(num) || 0) + 1);
  }

  // Bucket sort approach
  const buckets = Array.from({ length: nums.length + 1 }, () => []);
  for (const [num, freq] of count) {
    buckets[freq].push(num);
  }

  const result = [];
  for (let i = buckets.length - 1; i >= 0 && result.length < k; i--) {
    result.push(...buckets[i]);
  }

  return result.slice(0, k);
}

// Merge K Sorted Lists (use min heap in interview)
function mergeKLists(lists) {
  const dummy = new ListNode(0);
  let current = dummy;

  // Filter out empty lists and create array of [value, node]
  const nodes = lists.filter((list) => list).map((list) => list);

  while (nodes.length) {
    // Find minimum (in interview, use heap for O(log k))
    let minIdx = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < nodes.length; i++) {
      if (nodes[i].val < nodes[minIdx].val) {

    current.next = nodes[minIdx];
    current = current.next;

    if (nodes[minIdx].next) {
      nodes[minIdx] = nodes[minIdx].next;
    } else {
      nodes.splice(minIdx, 1);
    }
  }

  return dummy.next;
}
```

**Problems to Solve (Week 21-22):**
| # | Problem | Difficulty | Pattern |
|---|---------|------------|---------|
| 96 | Kth Largest Element in Array | Medium | QuickSelect/Heap |
| 97 | Top K Frequent Elements | Medium | Heap/Bucket Sort |
| 98 | K Closest Points to Origin | Medium | Heap |
| 99 | Merge K Sorted Lists | Hard | Heap |
| 100 | Find Median from Data Stream | Hard | Two Heaps |

### DSA Problem-Solving Framework

**For every problem, follow this process:**

```
1. UNDERSTAND (5 min)
   □ What are the inputs? Types? Constraints?
   □ What is the expected output?
   □ Walk through examples manually
   □ Ask clarifying questions
   □ Identify edge cases

2. PLAN (10 min)
   □ What pattern does this remind me of?
   □ What data structures could help?
   □ Can I solve a simpler version first?
   □ What's the brute force solution?
   □ How can I optimize?
   □ Estimate time/space complexity

3. IMPLEMENT (15 min)
   □ Write clean, readable code
   □ Use meaningful variable names
   □ Handle edge cases
   □ Think out loud (in interviews)

4. TEST (5 min)
   □ Trace through with examples
   □ Test edge cases
   □ Verify time/space complexity

5. OPTIMIZE (5 min if time)
   □ Can I reduce time complexity?
   □ Can I reduce space complexity?
   □ Is the code clean?
```

## Job Search Strategy

> **When to Start:** Month 4 (don't wait until you're "ready")
> **Daily Time:** 1-2 hours
> **Why This Matters:** You can be the best coder in the world, but if you don't apply, you won't get hired.

### The Reality of Job Hunting

Most developers make this mistake: they wait until they're "ready" to start applying.

**The truth:**

- You're never 100% ready
- Interview feedback teaches you what to learn
- The hiring process takes 1-3 months
- Rejections early = lessons learned early
- Companies have seasonal hiring cycles

4. **Tailor for ATS** (include keywords from job description)
5. **No photos** (for most tech companies)
6. **PDF format** (preserves formatting)
7. **File name:** `FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf`

**Resume Tools:**

| Tool          | Purpose            | Link                     |

### LinkedIn Strategy

**Profile Optimization:**

```
1. PHOTO
   - Professional headshot
   - Plain background
   - Good lighting
   - Smile!

2. HEADLINE (120 chars)
   "Full-Stack Developer | React | Node.js | Open to Opportunities"
   NOT: "Student at XYZ University"

3. ABOUT (2000 chars)
   - Who you are
   - What you do
   - What you're looking for
   - Your key skills
   - Call to action

   Example:
   "Full-stack developer passionate about building user-centric
   web applications. I specialize in React and Node.js, with
   experience in PostgreSQL and cloud deployment.

   Currently seeking full-time opportunities where I can
   contribute to meaningful products while growing as an engineer.

   Skills: React, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Docker

   Open to: Full-time roles | Remote | Bangalore/Hyderabad

   Let's connect! 📧 email@example.com"

4. FEATURED
   - Pin your best projects
   - Add portfolio link
   - Add GitHub profile

5. EXPERIENCE
   - Add projects as "self-employed" or "freelance"
   - Include internships
   - Describe achievements, not duties

6. SKILLS
   - Add all relevant skills
   - Reorder (top 3 are most visible)
   - Get endorsements from connections
```

**Daily LinkedIn Routine (15 min):**

```text
□ Accept connection requests
□ Send 5-10 new connection requests (developers, recruiters)
□ Comment meaningfully on 2-3 posts
□ Like/engage with recruiter content
□ Respond to all messages within 24 hours
```

**Weekly LinkedIn Routine:**

```text
□ Post 1-2 updates about your learning journey
□ Share a project you're working on
□ Engage with company pages you want to work for
□ Search for jobs and apply
```

**Connection Request Template:**

```
Hi [Name],

I'm a full-stack developer focused on React and Node.js.
I noticed you're [at Company X / a recruiter in tech /
working on interesting projects]. Would love to connect
and learn from your experience!

### Networking Strategy

**Where to Network:**

| Platform      | Strategy                                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Twitter/X     | Follow devs, join conversations, share learnings     |
| Discord       | Join communities: Reactiflux, The Odin Project, etc. |
| Reddit        | r/cscareerquestions, r/developersIndia               |
| Local Meetups | meetup.com, search for tech meetups in your city     |
| Hackathons    | devfolio.co, mlh.io                                  |

**Networking Rules:**

1. **Give before you ask** (answer questions, share resources)
2. **Be genuine** (don't spam with "hire me")
3. **Build relationships before you need them**
4. **Follow up** (after meeting someone, connect on LinkedIn)
5. **Be patient** (networking is long-term)

**Referrals:**

- 70% of jobs are filled through referrals
- A referral can 5-10x your response rate
- Build relationships BEFORE you need them

**How to Ask for a Referral:**

```
Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I noticed [Company] has an opening for
[Role], and I think I'd be a great fit based on my experience
with [relevant skills].

Would you be comfortable referring me? I've attached my resume
and the job link for your reference.

No pressure at all if you're not comfortable — I appreciate
our connection either way!

Thanks,
[Your Name]

[Job Link]
[Resume attached]
```

### Salary Negotiation

**Research Salaries First:**

| Resource        | Link                                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Levels.fyi      | https://levels.fyi (limited India data) |
| Glassdoor India | https://glassdoor.co.in                 |
| AmbitionBox     | https://ambitionbox.com                 |
| Blind           | TeamBlind app                           |
| LinkedIn Salary | LinkedIn Premium                        |

**Salary Ranges (India, 2024-26):**

| Level   | Service Companies | Startups  | Product Companies |
| ------- | ----------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Fresher | 3-6 LPA           | 4-10 LPA  | 8-20 LPA          |
| 1-2 YOE | 5-10 LPA          | 8-15 LPA  | 15-30 LPA         |
| 3-5 YOE | 10-18 LPA         | 15-30 LPA | 30-50 LPA         |

_LPA = Lakhs Per Annum_

**Negotiation Rules:**

1. **Never give a number first** — let them make an offer
2. **Always negotiate** — at least try
3. **Know your worth** — research beforehand
4. **Consider total compensation** — base + bonus + equity + benefits
5. **Get it in writing** — before accepting
6. **Be professional** — don't burn bridges

**When Asked About Salary Expectations:**

```
Approach 1: Deflect early in the process
"I'm focused on finding the right fit. I'm sure we can agree
on a fair number once we determine I'm the right candidate."

Approach 2: Give a range (after offer)
"Based on my research and the responsibilities of this role,
I was expecting something in the range of X to Y."

Approach 3: After receiving an offer
"Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about the role at [Company].
Based on my skills and the market rate, I was hoping for something
closer to [X]. Is there flexibility?"
```

**If Offer is Too Low:**

```
"I appreciate the offer and I'm very interested in the role.
However, based on my research and the value I can bring, I was
expecting something closer to [X]. Is there room to discuss this?"
```

---

### Handling Rejection

**Reality Check:**

- You WILL be rejected. A lot. This is normal.
- Even great candidates face 90%+ rejection rates for applications.
- Rejection is feedback, not failure.

**Expected Conversion Rates:**

```
Applications → Responses:     5-15%
Responses → Interviews:       30-50%
Interviews → Offers:          20-40%

Math: To get 1 offer, you might need:
100 applications → 10 responses → 4 interviews → 1 offer
```

**After Rejection:**

1. **Ask for feedback** (most won't respond, some will)
2. **Analyze** — Was it DSA? Projects? Communication?
3. **Improve** — Focus on the weak area
4. **Move on** — Apply to 5 more companies immediately
5. **Don't take it personally** — Fit matters, luck matters

**Rejection Response Template:**

```
Hi [Name],

Thank you for letting me know. While I'm disappointed, I
appreciate the opportunity to interview with [Company].

If possible, I'd greatly appreciate any feedback on areas
where I could improve.

I remain interested in [Company] and would love to be
considered for future opportunities.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

## Track B: Deep Fundamentals

> **Status:** 🔴 DEFERRED until employed
> **When to Start:** After 3 months settled in your first job
> **Daily Time:** Weekends only (3-5 hours)
> **Timeline:** 2-3 years for mastery

### Why Track B is Deferred

**Current Priority:** Get a job. Pay bills. Achieve financial stability.

**Track B is NOT cancelled.** It's postponed. Here's why:

1. **Financial reality** — You need income first
2. **Time constraints** — Can't do everything at once effectively
3. **Diminishing returns** — Deep CS knowledge doesn't help you get your FIRST job as much as Track A + DSA
4. **Long-term investment** — Track B pays off over years, not months

**After Employment:**

- You'll have income stability
- You can learn on weekends without pressure
- Work experience will make Track B concepts more meaningful
- You'll know which areas are most relevant to your career

---

### Track B Lite (Optional: During Employment)

If you want to start learning deep concepts while employed, here's a minimal approach:

**Weekend Schedule (2-3 hours Saturday OR Sunday):**

```text
Month 1-3:   Read "CODE" by Charles Petzold (1 chapter/week)
Month 4-6:   Nand2Tetris Part 1 (1 project every 2 weeks)
Month 7-9:   C basics (K&R or Beej's Guide)
Month 10+:   Choose based on interest/career needs
```

**Books to Read (One at a Time):**

1. **CODE** by Charles Petzold — How computers work (beginner-friendly)
2. **The C Programming Language** by K&R — Learn C properly
3. **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces** — Free, readable OS book
4. **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** — Modern systems bible

---

### When Track B Becomes Critical

Track B moves from "nice to have" to "must have" when:

1. **Targeting senior roles** (5+ years experience)
2. **Working on infrastructure/systems** (databases, compilers, OS)
3. **Performance-critical applications** (gaming, trading systems)
4. **Interviewing at top companies** (Google, Meta, etc. ask systems design)
5. **Building developer tools** (compilers, frameworks, libraries)
6. **Curiosity** — You genuinely want to understand how things work

For your first 1-2 years: **Track A skills are sufficient.** Focus on shipping products, gaining experience, and learning on the job.

---

## Mathematics Foundation

> **When:** As needed during DSA and Track B
> **Why:** Required for algorithms, competitive programming, and deep understanding
> **Approach:** Learn math when you need it, not as a prerequisite

You don't need to be a math genius. But certain math topics come up constantly in algorithms and competitive programming.

---

### M1: Essential Math for DSA

**These concepts appear in interviews:**

```text
1. BASIC ARITHMETIC
   - Modular arithmetic (a % b)
   - Integer division vs floating point
   - Overflow handling

2. LOGARITHMS
   - log₂(n) — appears in time complexity
   - Binary search runs in O(log n)
   - Balanced trees have O(log n) height

   Key insight: log₂(1,000,000) ≈ 20
   This is why binary search is so powerful!

3. EXPONENTS & POWERS
   - 2^10 = 1,024 ≈ 1,000
   - 2^20 ≈ 1,000,000
   - 2^30 ≈ 1,000,000,000

   Used in: bit manipulation, subset problems

4. BASIC PROBABILITY
   - Expected value
   - Probability of events
   - Used in: randomized algorithms, analysis

5. COMBINATORICS (Counting)
   - Permutations: n! / (n-r)!
   - Combinations: n! / (r! × (n-r)!)
   - Used in: DP problems, backtracking analysis
```

**Quick Reference:**

```javascript
// Modular arithmetic (prevents overflow)
(a + b) % m = ((a % m) + (b % m)) % m
(a * b) % m = ((a % m) * (b % m)) % m
(a - b) % m = ((a % m) - (b % m) + m) % m  // +m handles negatives

// GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) - Euclidean algorithm
function gcd(a, b) {
    while (b !== 0) {
        [a, b] = [b, a % b];
    }
    return a;
}

// LCM (Least Common Multiple)
function lcm(a, b) {
    return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
}

// Check if power of 2
function isPowerOfTwo(n) {
    return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) === 0;
}

// Fast exponentiation (x^n mod m)
function power(x, n, m) {
    let result = 1;
    x = x % m;
    while (n > 0) {
        if (n % 2 === 1) {
            result = (result * x) % m;
        }
        n = Math.floor(n / 2);
        x = (x * x) % m;
    }
    return result;
}

// Factorial (with memoization for multiple calls)
const factorial = (() => {
    const cache = [1, 1];
    return function(n) {
        if (cache[n] !== undefined) return cache[n];
        for (let i = cache.length; i <= n; i++) {
            cache[i] = cache[i-1] * i;
        }
        return cache[n];
    };
})();

// Combinations (n choose r)
function combinations(n, r) {
    if (r > n) return 0;
    if (r === 0 || r === n) return 1;
    return factorial(n) / (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r));
}

// Sieve of Eratosthenes (find all primes up to n)
function sieve(n) {
    const isPrime = new Array(n + 1).fill(true);
    isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;

    for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
        if (isPrime[i]) {
            for (let j = i * i; j <= n; j += i) {
                isPrime[j] = false;
            }
        }
    }

    return isPrime;
}

// Check if prime
function isPrime(n) {
    if (n < 2) return false;
    if (n === 2) return true;
    if (n % 2 === 0) return false;
    for (let i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2) {
        if (n % i === 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

## Soft Skills & Career

> **Why This Matters:** Technical skills get you interviews. Soft skills get you hired and promoted.

### Communication Skills

**Code Reviews — Giving Feedback:**

```text
DO:
✓ Be respectful — there's a human on the other side
✓ Explain WHY, not just WHAT
  Bad: "This is wrong"
  Good: "Consider using map() here for clarity — it makes the transformation explicit"
✓ Offer alternatives
✓ Distinguish between must-fix and nice-to-have
✓ Acknowledge what's done well
✓ Ask questions instead of demanding changes
  "Have you considered X?" vs "Do X instead"

DON'T:
✗ Be condescending
✗ Nitpick on style (use formatters instead)
✗ Make it personal
✗ Demand changes without explanation
```

**Code Reviews — Receiving Feedback:**

```text
DO:
✓ Assume positive intent
✓ Ask clarifying questions
✓ Thank reviewers for their time
✓ Explain your reasoning if you disagree
✓ Be open to learning

DON'T:
✗ Take it personally
✗ Get defensive
✗ Ignore feedback
✗ Argue about subjective preferences
```

**Technical Writing:**

````

**Documentation Tips:**

1. **Explain WHY, not just WHAT** — Code shows what, comments explain why
2. **Keep it updated** — Outdated docs are worse than no docs
3. **Include examples** — Show, don't just tell
4. **Structure for scanning** — Headings, bullets, code blocks
5. **Write for future you** — You'll forget in 6 months

---

### Reading Large Codebases

> This is a critical skill. 90% of your job is reading code, not writing it.

**The Strategy:**

```text
1. START WITH DOCUMENTATION
   □ README.md — overview, setup
   □ CONTRIBUTING.md — code organization
   □ Architecture docs (if they exist)
   □ API documentation

2. FIND THE ENTRY POINT
   □ main.js, index.ts, App.tsx
   □ server.js, app.py, main.go
   □ This is where execution begins

3. TRACE ONE FEATURE END-TO-END
   □ Pick a simple feature (e.g., user login)
   □ Follow the code from button click to database
   □ Don't try to understand everything at once

4. USE SEARCH AGGRESSIVELY
   □ grep, ripgrep, IDE search
   □ Search for function names, error messages
   □ "Find all references" is your friend

5. READ TESTS
   □ Tests show intended usage
   □ They're often simpler than production code
   □ They document edge cases

6. DRAW DIAGRAMS
   □ Box and arrow diagrams
   □ Data flow diagrams
   □ Sequence diagrams
   □ Even messy sketches help

7. EXPERIMENT
   □ Add console.log statements
   □ Change something small and see what breaks
   □ Run tests to understand behavior
````

**Tools:**

```text
IDE Features:
- "Go to Definition" (F12 in VS Code)
- "Find All References" (Shift+F12)
- "Call Hierarchy"
- Outline view

Command Line:
- grep -r "functionName" .
- git blame (who wrote this and when?)
- git log -p --follow filename (file history)

Debugging:
- Set breakpoints
- Step through code
- Inspect variables
```

### Open Source Contribution

> Shows you can work with others, read their code, and follow contribution guidelines.

**How to Start:**

```text
1. FIND PROJECTS YOU ACTUALLY USE
   - VS Code extensions you use
   - Libraries in your projects
   - Tools you rely on
   - You'll be more motivated

2. START SMALL
   - Documentation fixes (typos, clarity)
   - Adding tests
   - "Good first issue" labeled bugs
   - Don't try to add major features first

3. READ CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES
   - CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Code style requirements
   - PR template
   - Commit message format

4. UNDERSTAND BEFORE CHANGING
   - Read the codebase
   - Understand existing patterns
   - Don't "improve" style arbitrarily

5. MAKE FOCUSED PRs
   - One issue = one PR
   - Don't combine unrelated changes
   - Small PRs get reviewed faster

6. RESPOND TO FEEDBACK
   - Be respectful and grateful
   - Maintainers are often volunteers
   - Iterate quickly on requested changes
```

### Time Management

**For Developers:**

```text
1. POMODORO TECHNIQUE
   - 25 min focused work
   - 5 min break
   - After 4 pomodoros, 15-30 min break

2. TIME BLOCKING
   - Dedicate specific hours to specific tasks
   - Deep work in the morning (fewer distractions)
   - Meetings/communication in the afternoon

3. SINGLE-TASKING
   - Context switching is expensive
   - Close unnecessary tabs/apps
   - Put phone in another room

4. ENERGY MANAGEMENT
   - Hard problems when energy is high
   - Routine tasks when energy is low
   - Don't waste peak hours on email

5. SAYING NO
   - Not every opportunity is right for now
   - Protect your deep work time
   - It's okay to decline meetings without clear agendas
```

**Weekly Planning:**

```text
SUNDAY EVENING (30 min)
1. Review what you accomplished last week
2. Identify top 3 priorities for next week
3. Block time for those priorities
4. Identify potential blockers/meetings

DAILY (5 min)
1. Review today's tasks
2. Identify the ONE thing that must get done
3. Check calendar for meetings
4. End of day: quick reflection
```

---

### Working Effectively in a Team

**Communication:**

```text
ASYNC COMMUNICATION (Slack, Email)
- Lead with the ask (don't bury it)
- Provide context (why you're asking)
- Include relevant links/screenshots
- Indicate urgency level

Bad: "Hey, can we talk?"
Good: "Hey, I'm stuck on the authentication bug (#123).
       I've tried X and Y but neither worked.
       Could you take a look when you have 15 min?
       Not urgent — tomorrow is fine."

MEETINGS
- Come prepared (read agenda beforehand)
- Be on time
- Contribute or ask questions
- Take notes
- Send summary/action items after
```

**Collaboration:**

```text
1. OVER-COMMUNICATE
   - Status updates (what you're working on)
   - Blockers (what's stopping you)
   - Timeline changes (earlier or later than expected)

2. ASK FOR HELP
   - Try for 30 min first
   - Explain what you've tried
   - Ask specific questions
   - Share relevant code/logs

3. HELP OTHERS
   - Answer questions when you can
   - Share knowledge (docs, snippets)
   - Review PRs thoroughly but kindly

4. TAKE OWNERSHIP
   - If you see a problem, flag it
   - If you can fix it, offer to help
   - Follow through on commitments
```

### Dealing with Imposter Syndrome

**RECOMMENDED** (_Personally have Imposter Syndrome_)

**Reality:**

```text
EVERYONE feels like they don't belong sometimes. Including:
- Senior engineers
- Tech leads
- CTOs
- Famous open source maintainers

It's normal. It means you're pushing yourself.
```

**Strategies:**

```text
1. KEEP A "WINS" FILE
   - Document your accomplishments
   - Review when feeling down
   - Include small wins too

2. COMPARE TO YOURSELF, NOT OTHERS
   - You vs. 6 months ago
   - Not you vs. 10-year senior dev

3. REMEMBER THAT EVERYONE GOOGLES
   - No one memorizes everything
   - Even experts look things up
   - Knowing how to find answers IS a skill

4. EMBRACE "I DON'T KNOW"
   - It's okay to not know
   - "I don't know, but I'll find out"
   - Pretending to know is worse

5. CONTRIBUTE TO HELP OTHERS
   - Answer beginner questions
   - Write tutorials
   - Mentor someone earlier in the journey
   - Teaching reinforces that you DO know things
```

### Certification Path (If Needed)

**Some companies value certificates. Focus on:**

| Certificate             | Platform     | Cost | Value                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ---- | ------------------------- |
| freeCodeCamp Certs      | freeCodeCamp | Free | Shows commitment          |
| AWS Cloud Practitioner  | AWS          | $100 | Cloud knowledge baseline  |
| Meta Frontend Developer | Coursera     | $$   | Facebook name recognition |
| Google IT Support       | Coursera     | $$   | Entry-level IT            |

**Note:** For most software development jobs, portfolio projects and GitHub activity matter more than certificates. But certificates can help:

- Breaking into tech from another field
- Applying to large corporations
- Meeting HR checkboxes
- Building confidence

---

### Building a Learning System

**Don't just consume content. Build a system:**

```text
1. SCHEDULE
   - Same time every day
   - Protect this time
   - Start small (1 hour) and grow

2. TAKE NOTES
   - Obsidian or Notion
   - Write in your own words
   - Include code examples
   - Link related concepts

3. BUILD PROJECTS
   - After each major topic
   - Don't just copy tutorials
   - Modify and extend
   - Deploy and share

4. TEACH WHAT YOU LEARN
   - Twitter threads
   - Blog posts
   - Explain to friends
   - Rubber duck debugging

5. REVIEW REGULARLY
   - Weekly: What did I learn?
   - Monthly: What are my gaps?
   - Quarterly: Am I on track?

6. ADJUST AS NEEDED
   - Not working? Try different resource
   - Going too slow? Focus and remove distractions
   - Going too fast? Slow down and build more
```

## Final Notes

### The Reality Check

**This roadmap is aggressive.** Here's how to sustain it:

```text
1. SLEEP IS NON-NEGOTIABLE
   - 7+ hours minimum
   - Your brain consolidates learning during sleep
   - Cutting sleep to study more is counterproductive

2. EXERCISE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE
   - Badminton, walking, anything
   - Exercise improves cognitive function
   - Your brain works better when your body moves

3. REST IS PRODUCTIVE
   - Take one full evening off per week
   - Take one full day off per month
   - Burnout sets you back weeks

4. PROGRESS > PERFECTION
   - Done is better than perfect
   - You don't need to understand 100% before moving on
   - You'll revisit topics anyway

5. ADJUST AS NEEDED
   - If something takes longer, that's okay
   - Life happens
   - The timeline is a guide, not a law
```

---

### The Path Forward

**What to expect:**

```text
MONTH 1-2: Overwhelm
- There's so much you don't know
- Every concept reveals ten more
- This is normal. Push through.

MONTH 3-4: Clicking
- Concepts start connecting
- Code you wrote before looks embarrassingly bad
- That's growth!

MONTH 5-6: Building
- You can build real things
- Interviews feel less scary
- You're starting to see yourself as a developer

MONTH 7-10: Employment
- Getting interviews
- Learning from rejections
- Eventually, an offer

YEAR 2+: Growth
- Learning on the job
- Track B on weekends
- Becoming genuinely good

YEAR 3+: Mastery
- Deep understanding
- Can learn anything quickly
- The irreplaceable developer
```

---

### When You Feel Lost

**It will happen. Here's what to do:**

```text
1. GO BACK TO BASICS
   - Reread, redo, rebuild
   - Sometimes you moved too fast
   - It's okay to go back

2. TEACH WHAT YOU KNOW
   - Explain a concept to someone
   - Write a blog post
   - Teaching reveals gaps

3. BUILD SOMETHING
   - Theory without practice is useless
   - If stuck in tutorial hell, just build
   - Messy code > no code

4. ASK FOR HELP
   - Stack Overflow
   - Discord communities
   - Reddit (r/learnprogramming)
   - No question is too basic

5. TAKE A BREAK
   - Sometimes the brain needs rest
   - Go for a walk
   - Sleep on it
   - Answers come when you stop trying
```

---

### The Mindset

```text
"I am not talented. I am obsessed."
    - Become obsessed with understanding

"Done is better than perfect."
    - Ship it. You can improve later.

"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.
 The second best time is now."
    - Start today. Not Monday. Today.

"Consistency beats intensity."
    - 1 hour daily > 10 hours once a week

"Imposter syndrome means you're growing."
    - If it's easy, you're not learning
```
