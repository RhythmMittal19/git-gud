## 🧠 Knowledge Base (Notes)

Before writing this code, I studied the underlying concepts. You can read my detailed notes here:

- [HTML Fundamentals](../../knowledge/concepts/Web-Development/html/html-fundamentals.md) - _Covers Boilerplate, Semantics, and SEO tags._
- [Web Basics](../../knowledge/concepts/Web-Development/how-web-works.md) - _How the web actually works._

## 🛠️ Key Takeaways

> "HTML is the skeleton. Without it, CSS has nothing to style and JS has nothing to manipulate."

- **Learned:** Semantic HTML (`<nav>`, `<article>`) is better than `<div>` soup.
- **Struggle:** Understanding relative paths (`../`) took some practice.
